= Rearrange and array in place
〔useLatex〕

This article is about an algorithmic problem.
I did not find a solution to this problem either thinking about it, searching the net or talking to friends.
The problem itself is simple.
At the first reading, it may lure the reader into a false sense of simplicity.
You may feel that this should not be an issue.
But it is.
At least for me.

Nothing Java.
Nothing programming other than it is about an algorithmic problem.

〔section Problem Statement〕

There is an array of 〔latex 2n〕 elements.
The array is 〔latex A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_b\}〕.
What steps should be taken to rearrange the array so that 〔latex A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}〕 with limited, maximum 〔latex O(1)〕 memory, and 〔latex O(n)〕 time.

〔section ChatGPT solution〕

Sine generative AI is sweeping the media and the internet; I thought that I should try to use it to solve the problem.
After all, if it takes my job just in a few years, at least we can let it do some work for us till then.

Here is the answer, no surprise: totally wrong:

.Wrong answer from ChapGPT
[WARNING]
====
To rearrange the array 〔latex A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}〕 into 〔latex A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}〕 with limited, maximum O(1) memory, and 〔latex O(n)〕 time you can follow the steps below:

Traverse the array and for each element at index 〔latex i〕, swap it with the element at index 〔latex i+n〕.

****
  For i=1 to n:
    Swap A[i] with A[i+n]
****

After the traversal is complete, the array will be rearranged as 〔latex A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}〕.
The above algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and uses only O(1) memory as only a constant number of variables are used for swapping elements in the array.

After following these steps, the original array 〔latex A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}〕 would be rearranged as 〔latex A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}〕.
====

The described algorithm is 〔latex O(n)〕 time and 〔latex O(1)〕 memory, but the resulting array will be 〔latex A=\{b_1,b_2, ... , b_n,a_1,a_2, ... , a_n\}〕.

NOTE: I am not worried about being replaced by an AI as a software engineer. Yet.

〔section Without the 〔latex| O(1)〕memory constraint〕

The problem is not that hard if you do not have the 〔latex O(1)〕 memory constraint.
As a matter of fact it is so easy that it can be solved even by ChapGPT.
Or can it?

.Simpler problem, still not good answer from ChapGPT
[NOTE]
====
To rearrange the array 〔latex A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}〕 into 〔latex A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}〕, you can follow the steps below:

Create two new arrays, one for the 〔latex a〕 values and another for the 〔latex b〕 values.
Initialize an empty array for the 〔latex a〕 values, say 〔latex a_{new}〕.
Initialize an empty array for the 〔latex b〕 values, say 〔latex b_{new}〕.
Traverse the original array and separate the 〔latex a〕 and 〔latex b〕 values into two separate arrays.

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex a_i〕 `to` 〔latex a_{new}〕
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex b_i〕 `to` 〔latex b_{new}〕

[%hardbreaks]
``For i=n+1 to 2n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex b_i〕 `to` 〔latex a_{new}〕
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex a_i〕 `to` 〔latex b_{new}〕
****

Concatenate the two new arrays in the desired order to get the final result.
Concatenate 〔latex a_{new}〕 and 〔latex b_{new}〕 in the order 〔latex a_{new}, b_{new}〕 to get the desired result.
After following these steps, the original array 〔latex A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}〕 would be rearranged as 〔latex A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}〕.
====

I believe there is no need to explain why the solution is wrong, and overly complicated.
The allocation of the two arrays is unnecessary.
We need only one extra array of length 〔latex 2n〕, say 〔latex T〕.
Then the code will look:

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex a_i〕 `to` 〔latex T〕
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` 〔latex b_i〕 `to` 〔latex T〕
****

Voilà, you have the result in 〔latex T〕.

NOTE: Still not worried.

〔section Without the 〔latex| O(n)〕 time constraint: 〔latex O(n^2)〕〕

How about giving some extra time instead of extra memory?
Let's keep the 〔latex O(1)〕 memory constraint, but allow 〔latex O(n^2)〕 time.

This problem is also simple to solve, but for some reason, ChatGPT gave such a foolish answer that I decided not to copy here.
I know, you are curious, but it has no value, totally gibberish.
The solution is

. to take 〔latex b_i〕out from the array for every 〔latex i=1,n〕one by one,
. push every element one position higher below 〔latex b_i〕 until we get to the place where 〔latex b_i〕 will get
. put 〔latex b_i〕 to its place.

[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Store`` 〔latex b_i〕 ``being at the position`` 〔latex| n+i〕``to a variable named`` 〔latex x〕
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Move all objects from`` 〔latex| 2i〕 ``till`` 〔latex n+i〕 ``to the next position``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Put `` 〔latex b_i〕``from the variable`` 〔latex x〕``to the position 2i``
****


During the first step, we have to move 〔latex n-1〕 objects.
During the second step, we have to move 〔latex n-2〕 objects, and so on.
Moving all the 〔latex b_i; i=1,n〕elements will need 〔latex| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}〕 moves.
It means that this algorithm is 〔latex O(n^2)〕 time.

〔section Without the 〔latex| O(n)〕 time constraint: 〔latex O(n \log n)〕〕

We know that there is a faster, more complex solution that is 〔latex O(n \log n)〕 time.
Let's have a look at that:

If the array length is 2, in other words, the array is 〔latex A=\{a_1,b_1\}〕, then the solution is trivial.
In that case do not need to do anything, just return the array as it is.

.Funny (wrong) suggestion from CoPilot
****
__If the array is longer, then we can split it into two parts, rearrange them separately, and then merge the results.__

The above sentence is not part of the normal flow of this article.
I write this article with CoPilot switched on.
The above sentence was suggested by CoPilot for this location.

It is fun to write articles with CoPilot switched on (pronounce it as Copy-a-Lot).
I do not say it is easier, or less work.
Sometimes it feels like a little kid running around and making a mess while you try to clean your flat.
Rather the contrary, but undeniably _more fun._
Cursive words in the above paragraphs all were suggested by CoPilot.

And now, just let's go on with the normal text of the article.
****

Assume that the array length is 〔latex n=2^m〕.
Divide the array into four parts:

* 〔latex Q_1=[a_1-a_\frac n2]〕,
* 〔latex Q_2=[a_{\frac n2+1},a_n]〕,
* 〔latex Q_3=[b_1-b_\frac n2]〕,
* 〔latex Q_4=[b_{\frac n2+1},b_n]〕,

Swap the elements of 〔latex Q_2〕 and 〔latex Q_3〕in a single loop:

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to `` 〔latex| \frac n2〕``:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Swap`` 〔latex a_{\frac n2+i}〕 ``and`` 〔latex b_i〕
****

Essentially, we transform the array 〔latex Q_1|Q_2|Q_3|Q_4〕 into 〔latex Q_1|Q_3|Q_2|Q_4〕.
After this, the algorithm can be applied for the sub arrays 〔latex Q_1|Q_3〕 and 〔latex Q_1|Q_4〕.

The assumption that 〔latex n=2^m〕 helps to halve the array down to length 2.
When the length of the array is not some power of two, the halving is not trivial.

The algorithm running time 〔latex T(n) = 2T(\frac n2) + O(n)〕.
The 〔latex O(n)〕term is the time needed to swap the elements of 〔latex Q_2〕and 〔latex Q_3〕.
The resulting time complexity is 〔latex O(n \log n)〕.

〔section Conclusion, and Takeaway〕

I shared this "simple" algorithmic problem with you.
It is haunting me for a few years.
The beauty of this problem is that it is simple, but not trivial.
If you happen to know the answer, tell me!
I am old enough accepting my limits, and it will more amaze me to see the solution than angry about wy I have not seen it before.

.CoPilot's suggestion
****
__The takeaway is that you should not be afraid of simple problems.__
****

How about AI?
What is the merit of all this?
Should we be afraid of AI?

The answer is no.
There is no point of being afraid, generally.
We can be prepared, aware, but not afraid.
AI in its current form can help us solve problems, but it is immature.
I expect the change and maturing of AI will be extremely rapid to a point.

It will transform how we work, but will not work instead of us or replace us.
Some people will lose jobs, but new jobs will be created.

In the 1950s, people were afraid of computers.
As a matter of fact, the women doing the numerical calculations were called computers.
Their job does not exist today, but it did not disappear from day one to the next.
It took years to disappear.
We still do some calculations by hand.
We still use calculators on the job site.
There is even an anachronistic calculator app on the iPhone.

Something similar will happen with AI.
The change will be gradual.
We will have time to adapt.
AI development is fast, and we feel that the development of new technologies speeds up.
However, this speed is limited by the adoption rate of humans.
Humans do not change that fast.
