There are many articles on the internet that try to predict the future related to AI.
Many predict that many jobs will simply disappear.
The world is changing.

In this article, I will discuss the economy aspect from a point of view that I have not seen yet discussed.

〔section What are you afraid of?〕

When someone asks if AI will take their job, they are not worried about the work itself.
They are worried about the income.
They are worried about the life they can live.
This includes necessities, but other things as well, like heated/cooled home, possibility to relax, spend time and reproduce.
The need for these is driven by the basic instincts of the human being.

Therefore, the question you should ask is not if AI takes your job, but if AI transform our lives.

Even if we understand that this is not the job itself that we care about, the question is still ambiguous.
We can ask about the near future as well as the far future.
How will AI affect my life in the next few years and how will it affect my life in the next few decades?

In the next section, we will discuss a bit about these two.
When trying to imagine what will happen, we will try to look at the past and see what happened when the world changed.
Similar changes happened in the past, and the change we see now is not the first one, and radically different from the previous ones. We will visit the differences and the similarities.

〔section Short Term〕

In the short term, the AI will not take your job.
But I cannot tell you how short that short term is.
AI is developing and got into a state when it is still a toy, but many people, including those who control the money, recognize that this is something that will change the world.
It has its pitfalls and bugs, like generating a programmer picture with three hands, but it is getting better.
There is funding for that, and today, money makes the world go around in technology.

What you will see is that it will first change your job, especially how you communicate with others.
It will help you to do your job, and you will become more effective.

This is the first point where you may lose your job.
If a job was performed by 10 persons in the past, but it can be done by 2 persons utilizing AI then the business can extend or 8 people will lose their job.
Or perhaps the mixture of the two.

AI does not take your job.
Those workers who are better using AI and more productive will.

There are many professions which articles say are in danger.
Is your job one of them?
Ask yourself the question: "How much time do you waste doing things that you feel routine?"
If this is the majority of the time,AI will probably eliminate these parts and make you more productive.

For example, writing these articles that I have created a few in the last decade, I had a lot of routine work.
Checking the spelling, the grammar, the style is a tedious task since I am not a native English speaker.
When I wrote my books for Packt four years ago, a lot of work was invested by editors trying to improve my English and then by me fixing the text that the editors changed.

A few years later, I started to write a next book.
(I only created the first chapter, and then it was never finished, but it is another story.)
This time I used an AI-enhanced grammar checker.
The language editor changed only one sentence in the whole chapter.
Still, if you are a native speaker, you can tell I am not.

When I write this article, I ask ChatGPT: "Please rewrite the following paragraph to proper English."
And it does.
In this case, there is no job in danger, as I have never had the luxury to have an editor reading my articles.
The quality, I hope, however, is better.
