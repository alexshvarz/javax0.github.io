= Rearrange and array in place
:stem: latexmath





This article is about an algorithmic problem.
I did not find a solution to this problem either thinking about it, searching the net or talking to friends.
The problem itself is simple.
At the first reading may lure the reader into false sensing of simplicity.
You may feel that this should not be an issue.
But it is.
At least for me.

Nothing Java.
Nothing programming other than it is about an algorithmic problem.

== 1. Problem Statement

There is an array of stem:[2n] elements.
The array is stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_b\}].
What steps should be taken to rearrange the array so that stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}] with limited, maximum stem:[O(1)] memory, and stem:[O(n)] time.

== 2. ChatGPT solution

Sine generative AI is sweeping the media and the internet, I thought that I should try to use it to solve the problem.
After all, if it will take my job just in a few years, at least we can let it do some work for us till then.

Here is the answer, no surprise: totally wrong:

.Wrong answer from ChapGPT
[WARNING]
====
To rearrange the array stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}] into stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}] with limited, maximum O(1) memory, and stem:[O(n)] time you can follow the steps below:

Traverse the array and for each element at index stem:[i], swap it with the element at index stem:[i+n].

  For i=1 to n:
    Swap A[i] with A[i+n]

After the traversal is complete, the array will be rearranged as stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}].
The above algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and uses only O(1) memory as only a constant number of variables are used for swapping elements in the array.

After following these steps, the original array stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}] would be rearranged as stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}].
====

The described algorithm is stem:[O(n)] time and stem:[O(1)] memory, but the resulting array will be stem:[A=\{b_1,b_2, ... , b_n,a_1,a_2, ... , a_n\}].

NOTE: I am not worried about being replaced by an AI as a software engineer. Yet.
