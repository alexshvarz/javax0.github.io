= Rearrange and array in place
:stem: latex

This article is about an algorithmic problem.
I did not find a solution to this problem either thinking about it, searching the net or talking to friends.
The problem itself is simple.
At the first reading may lure the reader into false sensing of simplicity.
You may feel that this should not be an issue.
But it is.
At least for me.

Nothing Java.
Nothing programming other than it is about an algorithmic problem.

== 1. Problem Statement

There is an array of stem:[2n] elements.
The array is stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_b\}].
What steps should be taken to rearrange the array so that stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}] with limited, maximum stem:[O(1)] memory, and stem:[O(n)] time.

== 2. ChatGPT solution

Sine generative AI is sweeping the media and the internet, I thought that I should try to use it to solve the problem.
After all, if it will take my job just in a few years, at least we can let it do some work for us till then.

Here is the answer, no surprise: totally wrong:

.Wrong answer from ChapGPT
[WARNING]
====
To rearrange the array stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}] into stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}] with limited, maximum O(1) memory, and stem:[O(n)] time you can follow the steps below:

Traverse the array and for each element at index stem:[i], swap it with the element at index stem:[i+n].

****
  For i=1 to n:
    Swap A[i] with A[i+n]
****

After the traversal is complete, the array will be rearranged as stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}].
The above algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and uses only O(1) memory as only a constant number of variables are used for swapping elements in the array.

After following these steps, the original array stem:[A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}] would be rearranged as stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}].
====

The described algorithm is stem:[O(n)] time and stem:[O(1)] memory, but the resulting array will be stem:[A=\{b_1,b_2, ... , b_n,a_1,a_2, ... , a_n\}].

NOTE: I am not worried about being replaced by an AI as a software engineer. Yet.

== 3. Without the stem:[ O(1)]memory constraint

The problem is not that hard if you do not have the stem:[O(1)] memory constraint.
As a matter of fact it is so easy that it can be solved even by ChapGPT.
Or can it?

.Simpler problem, still not good answer from ChapGPT
[NOTE]
====
To rearrange the array stem:[A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}] into stem:[A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}], you can follow the steps below:

Create two new arrays, one for the stem:[a] values and another for the stem:[b] values.
Initialize an empty array for the stem:[a] values, say stem:[a_{new}].
Initialize an empty array for the stem:[b] values, say stem:[b_{new}].
Traverse the original array and separate the stem:[a] and stem:[b] values into two separate arrays.

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[a_i] `to` stem:[a_{new}]
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[b_i] `to` stem:[b_{new}]

[%hardbreaks]
``For i=n+1 to 2n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[b_i] `to` stem:[a_{new}]
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[a_i] `to` stem:[b_{new}]
****

Concatenate the two new arrays in the desired order to get the final result.
Concatenate stem:[a_{new}] and stem:[b_{new}] in the order stem:[a_{new}, b_{new}] to get the desired result.
After following these steps, the original array stem:[A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}] would be rearranged as stem:[A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}].
====

I believe there is no need to explain why the solution is wrong, and overly complicated.
The allocation of the two arrays is unnecessarily complicated.
We need only one extra array of length stem:[2n], say stem:[T].
Then the code will look:

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[a_i] `to` stem:[T]
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` `Add` stem:[b_i] `to` stem:[T]
****

Voil√†, you have the result in stem:[T].

NOTE: Still not worried.

== 4. Without the stem:[ O(n)] time constraint: stem:[O(n^2)]

This problem is also simple to solve, but for some reason ChaptGPT gave such a foolish answer that I decided not to copy here.
The solution is

. to take stem:[b_i]out from the array for every stem:[i=1,n]one by one,
. push every element one position higher below stem:[b_i] until we get to the place where stem:[b_i] will get
. put stem:[b_i] to its place.

[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to n:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Store`` stem:[b_i] ``being at the position`` stem:[ n+i]``to a variable named`` stem:[x]
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Move all objects from`` stem:[ 2i] ``till`` stem:[n+i] ``to the next position``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Put `` stem:[b_i]``from the variable`` stem:[x]``to the position 2i``
****


During the first step we have to move stem:[n-1] objects.
During the second step we have to move stem:[n-2] objects, and so on.
Moving all the stem:[b_i; i=1,n]elements will need stem:[sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}] moves.
It means that this algorithm is stem:[O(n^2)] time.

== 5. Without the stem:[ O(n)] time constraint: stem:[O(n \log n)]

There is a more complex solution that is stem:[O(n \log n)] time.

If the array length is 2, a.k.a. the array is stem:[A=\{a_1,b_1\}], then the solution is trivial.
In that case do not need to do anything, just return the array as it is.

.Funny (wrong) suggestion from CoPilot
****
__If the array is longer, then we can split it into two parts, rearrange them separately, and then merge the results.__

It is fun to write articles with CoPilot switched on (pronounce it as Copy-a-Lot).
I do not say it is easier, or less work.
Rather the contrary, but undeniably _more fun._
Cursive word in the above paragraphs all were suggested by CoPilot.
****

Assume that the array length is stem:[n=2^m].
Divide the array into four parts:

* stem:[Q_1=[a_1-a_\frac n2]],
* stem:[Q_2=[a_{\frac n2+1},a_n]],
* stem:[Q_3=[b_1-b_\frac n2]],
* stem:[Q_4=[b_{\frac n2+1},b_n]],

Swap the elements of stem:[Q2] and stem:[Q3]in a single loop:

****
[%hardbreaks]
``For i=1 to `` stem:[ \frac n2]``:``
`` `` `` `` `` `` `` `` ``Swap`` stem:[a_{\frac n2+i}] ``and`` stem:[b_i]
****

Essentially we transform the array stem:[Q_1|Q_2|Q_3|Q_4] into stem:[Q_1|Q_3|Q_2|Q_4].
After this, the algorithm can be applied for the sub arrays stem:[Q_1|Q_3] and stem:[Q_1|Q_4].

The assumption that stem:[n=2^m]helps to halve the array down to the length 2.

The algorithm running time stem:[T(n) = 2T(\frac n2) + O(n)].
The stem:[O(n)]term is the time needed to swap the elements of stem:[Q_2]and stem:[Q_3].
The resulting time complexity is stem:[O(n \log n)].
