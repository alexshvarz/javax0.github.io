<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java has a logging solution built in since Java 1.4 At the time there were already some existing logging frameworks and everybody was expecting that use of the different logging frameworks will end when there is one supported by Java built into the JDK. The expectation was wrong. You can not command people what to use for their programming needs. They will use the solution that fits their needs best. If you provide a solution that they love, they will use it. Part of it is marketing, part of it is the product: price, features, performance. Logging frameworks developed and Java built-in logged. You certainly have heard of log4j, Apache Commons Logging, logback, slf4j.</p>
