<h2 id="1-nested-classes-and-private-methods">1. Nested classes and private methods</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have a class inside another class they can see each others <code>private</code> methods. It is not well known among Java developers. Many candidates during interviews say that <code>private</code> is a visibility that lets a code see a member if that is in the same class. This is actually true, but it would be more precise to say that there is a class that both the code and the member is in. When we have nested and inner classes it can happen that the <code>private</code> member and the code using it is in the same class and at the same time they are also in different classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, if I have two nested classes in a top-level class then the code in one of the nested classes can see a <code>private</code> member of the other nested class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It starts to be interesting when we look at the generated code. The JVM does not care about classes inside other classes. It deals with JVM "top-level" classes. The compiler will create <code>.class</code> files that will have a name like <code>A$B.class</code> when you have a class named <code>B</code> inside a class <code>A</code>. There is a <code>private</code> method in <code>B</code> callable from <code>A</code> then the JVM sees that the code in <code>A.class</code> calls the method in <code>A$B.class</code>. The JVM checks access control. When we discussed this with juniors somebody suggested that probably the JVM does not care the modifier. That is not true. Try to compile <code>A.java</code> and <code>B.java</code>, two top-level classes with some code in <code>A</code> calling a <code>public</code> method in <code>B</code>. When you have <code>A.class</code> and <code>B.class</code> modify the method in <code>B.java</code> from being <code>public</code> to be <code>private</code> and recompile <code>B</code> t a new <code>B.class</code>. Start the application and you will see that the JVM cares about the access modifiers a lot. Still, you can invoke in the example above from <code>A.class</code> a method in <code>A$B.class</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To resolve this conflict Java generates extra synthetic methods that are inherently package private, call the original private method inside the same class and are callable as far as the JVM access control is considered. On the other hand, the Java compiler will not compile the code if you figure out the name of the generated method and try to call in from the Java source code directly. I wrote about in details more than 4 years ago <a href="https://javax0.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/syntethic-and-bridge-methods/" class="bare">https://javax0.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/syntethic-and-bridge-methods/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a seasoned developer then you probably think that this is a weird and revolting hack. Java is so clean, elegant, concise and pure except this hack. And also perhaps the hack of the <code>Integer</code> cache that makes small <code>Integer</code> objects (typical test values) to be equal using the <code>==</code> while larger values are only <code>equals()</code> but not <code>==</code> (typical production values). But other than the synthetic classes and <code>Integer</code> cache hack Java is clean, elegant, concise and pure. (You may get I am a Monty Python fan.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason for this is that nested classes were not part of the original Java, it was added only to version 1.1 The solution was a hack, but there were more important things to do at that time, like introducing JIT compiler, JDBC, RMI, reflection and some other things that we take today for granted. That time the question was not if the solution is nice and clean. Rather the question was if Java will survive at all and be a mainstream programming language or dies and remains a nice try. That time I was still working as a sales rep and coding was only a hobby because coding jobs were scarce in East Europe, they were the mainly boring bookkeeping applications and were low paid. Those were a bit different times, the search engine was named AltaVista, we drank water from the tap and Java had different priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequence is that for more than 20 years we are having slightly larger JAR files, slightly slower java execution (unless the JIT optimizes the call chain) and obnoxious warnings in the IDE suggesting that we better have package protected methods in nested classes instead of <code>private</code> when we use it from top-level or other nested classes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-nest-hosts">2. Nest Hosts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now it seems that this 20-year technical debt will be solved. The <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181" class="bare">http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/181</a> gets into Java 11 and it will solve this issue by introducing a new notion: nest. Currently, the Java bytecode contains some information about the relationship between classes. The JVM has information that a certain class is a nested class of another class and this is not only the name. This information could work for the JVM to decide on whether a piece of code in one class is allowed or is not allowed to access a <code>private</code> member of another class, but the JEP-181 development has something more general. As times changed JVM is not the Java Virtual Machine anymore. Well, yes, it is, at least the name, however, it is a virtual machine that happens to execute bytecode compiled from Java. Or for the matter from some other languages. There are many languages that target the JVM and keeping that in mind the JEP-181 does not want to tie the new access control feature of the JVM to a particular feature of the Java language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JEP-181 defines the notion of a <code>NestHost</code> and <code>NestMembers</code> as attributes of a class. The compiler fills these fields and when there is access to a private member of a class from a different class then the JVM access control can check: are the two classes in the same nest or not? If they are in the same nest then the access is allowed, otherwise not. We will have methods added to the reflective access so we can get the list of the classes that are in a nest.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do we like it or not? Where is the fail-fast principle? Why does the Java runtime start to execute the class and check the nest structure only when it is very much needed? The reason, as many times in the case of Java: backward compatibility. The JVM can check the nest structure consistency when all the classes are loaded. The classes are only loaded when they are used. It would have been possible to change the classloading in Java 11 and load all the nested classes along with the nesting host, but it would break backward compatibility. If nothing else the lazy singleton pattern would break apart and we do not want that. We love singleton, but only when single malt (it is).</p>
