<p>You are a Java programmer, so you know what I am talking about. <code>public</code> modifiers make a method or field accessible from anywhere in the application. That is the simple part. But can you tell me the difference between <code>protected</code> and package private? (Hint: package private is the protection of a method or a field when you do not write any access modifier in front of it. Be aware! I lie!) My interview experience is that many do not know. Do I consider that as a no go for a Java developer? Not really. You may still be a good Java developer even if you do not know that. Perhaps now you will look it up somewhere.

<p>I tell you something more interesting.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Literally, none of the candidates know what <code>private</code> is. And you, reading this article, also do not know.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, this is very provocative. You may be one of the few who happen to fill his brain with such a useless information and you may even have read the Java specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most Java programmers think that private methods and fields are accessible only from within the class. Some even think that only from within the object instance. They believe that</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class PrivateAccessOtherObject {
    public PrivateAccessOtherObject(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }
    private int i;
    void copyiTo(PrivateAccessOtherObject other){
        other.i = i;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>is not possible. (It is.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what is private?</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The recent <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#d5e9845">JLS</a> says that <em>A private class member or constructor is accessible only within the body of the top level class (ยง7.6) that encloses the declaration of the member or constructor.</em></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example in the Java specification is not the best describing the rule. Perhaps that is just a simple example. Something like this may be better explaining the concept:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class PrivateFieldsContainingClass {
    private static class NestedClass {
        private int i;
    }
    private NestedClass nestedClassInstance = new NestedClass();
    void set(int i) {
        nestedClassInstance.i = i;
    }
    int get() {
        return nestedClassInstance.i;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The field <code>i</code> is accessible from the enclosing class as well as from inside the <code>NestedClass</code>. This example is also simple but more to the point that the specification example misses. Is there any real use of this possibility? <a href="http://javax0.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/design-pattern-immutable-embedded-builder/">Not really.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bonus question: why did I say I was lying?</p>
