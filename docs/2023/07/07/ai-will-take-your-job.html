    <div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are numerous articles on the internet attempting to predict the future of AI, with many forecasting the disappearance of numerous jobs, leading to significant changes in the world.
In this article, I aim to explore an aspect of the economy that has yet to be extensively discussed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="1-what-are-you-afraid-of">1. What are you afraid of?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When individuals express concerns about AI taking their jobs, their worry stems not from the work itself, but rather from the potential impact on their income and the life they can lead.
This includes meeting basic needs as well as the ability to have a comfortable home, relax, spend time with loved ones, and pursue personal fulfillmentâ€”needs driven by our fundamental human instincts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, the crucial question to ask is not whether AI will take your job, but rather how AI will transform our lives.
Even when we acknowledge that it&#8217;s not solely about the job, the question remains ambiguous.
We can consider both the near future and the distant future: How will AI affect our lives in the next few years, and how will it impact our lives in the next few decades?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/OIG.e07ooq5PbXIziXNWuToB.jpg" alt="OIG.e07ooq5PbXIziXNWuToB" width="500px">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Image generated by AI (Paint me a picture of a software developer who looks said, and he is looking at some program printout, which is machine code, hexa codes, and there is an AI machine nearby that emits a lot of such code in electronic format stylized as clouds.)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following section, we will delve into these two timeframes, attempting to imagine what may unfold by reflecting on the past and considering previous instances of significant change.
It&#8217;s worth noting that similar transformative shifts have occurred before, and the current one is not the first, though it may be vastly different from its predecessors.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-short-term">2. Short Term</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the short term, AI will not take away your job, though determining the exact duration of this "short term" is uncertain.
AI is still in a developmental stage and can be seen as a sort of toy, but many individuals, including those in control of resources, recognize its potential to reshape the world.
While it has its flaws and limitations, such as generating images of programmers with three hands, it continues to improve.
Funding is readily available, and money drives the technological advancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What you will observe is that AI will initially change the nature of your job, particularly in terms of how you communicate with others.
It will assist you in performing your tasks, thereby increasing your effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This brings us to the point where your job may be at risk.
If a task previously required 10 individuals but can now be accomplished by just 2 people using AI, then either the business can expand or 8 people may lose their jobs, or perhaps a combination of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AI itself doesn&#8217;t take away jobs; rather, those individuals who can effectively utilize AI and enhance their productivity will thrive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Numerous articles mention various professions that are deemed to be in danger.
Is your job among them?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pose yourself the following question: "How much time do you spend on tasks that feel routine?" If the majority of your time is spent on such routine activities, AI will likely eliminate these parts and enable you to be more productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, in my case, when writing articles like the ones I have composed over the past decade, I encountered a great deal of repetitive work.
Checking spelling, grammar, and style proved to be a tedious task since English is not my native language.
When I authored books for Packt four years ago, considerable effort was invested by editors to improve my English, followed by my own revisions to the text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few years later, I embarked on writing another book, (although I only completed the first chapter, with the rest left unfinished).
This time, I employed an AI-enhanced grammar checker.
The language editor made only one alteration to the entire chapter.
Nevertheless, as a native speaker, one can still discern that English is not my first language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To improve that, I write this article, I request ChatGPT to assist me by saying, "Please rewrite the following paragraph in proper English." And it does.
In this case, there is no job at risk, as I have never had the luxury of having an editor review my articles.
Nonetheless, I hope the quality has improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing articles is indeed one area where AI can assist in eliminating routine tasks, and another example worth considering is the field of law.
There has been recent hype suggesting that AI could replace lawyers, with claims that ChatGPT could even pass the bar exam.
However, it is essential to reevaluate the definition of a lawyer in light of technological advancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously, a lawyer could be defined as someone who passed the bar exam and practiced law.
This definition was as valid as saying "everything that flies is a bird" until airplanes were invented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, it is crucial to reconsider that definition.
Traditionally, a significant part of a lawyer&#8217;s work involved knowledge of the law, finding relevant cases for references, and similar tasks.
However, this aspect of the work was not the primary source of value added.
Such tasks could be performed by assistants or paralegals.
The true value lies elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a non-lawyer, I cannot pinpoint exactly where this value lies within the legal profession.
Nonetheless, I am confident that the most critical aspect of their work is human communication.
This element cannot be replaced by AI because AI is not human and never will be.
While we can interact with AI and may not even notice the difference, most people would not trust an AI to be their lawyer, doctor, or any other profession where high stakes are involved.
Any potential change in this regard would be gradual and slow, as it depends on people&#8217;s perception rather than technological advancements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, it is evident that short-term changes are inevitable.
There will be shifts in the way we work, and certain jobs will gradually disappear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving forward, let&#8217;s now shift our focus to the long term.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-long-term">3. Long Term</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the long term, AI is expected to become significantly more powerful.
Presently, we have standalone AI tools that possess various limitations.
However, as time progresses, many of these limitations are likely to diminish, and integration of AI applications will become more prevalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, I engage in a process where I copy and paste my basic sentences into ChatGPT for rewriting, and then transfer them back to my text editor.
I already have two AI tools, Co-Pilot (a code completion tool) and Grazie (a grammar checker), integrated into my text editor.
Looking ahead, it is foreseeable that I will be able to write directly within ChatGPT, with seamless integration into my text editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What will be the consequences of the AI development considering jobs?
Let&#8217;s imagine a future, where AI is an advancement and can do 90% of what humans can do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When such technology changes happened in the past, the eliminated professions were replaced by new ones.
We started agriculture and there was no need for hunters.
Instead, we needed farmers.
We invented the steam engine and there was no need for horses.
Instead, we needed engineers.
We invented the computer and there was no need for typists.</p>
