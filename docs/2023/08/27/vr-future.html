<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtual reality is a technology when you wear some device projecting a non-existent world into your senses.
This way, you partially or completely lose the connection to the real world and are immersed in the virtual world.
Current technology does not allow a complete loss of connection to the real world, and the senses are mainly limited to vision and hearing.
Usually, two LCD devices with special optics are mounted on your head, and different sensors track your head movement.
The computers display pictures on the LCDs that change as you move your head, showing a static or dynamic virtual reality around you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article, I will write about the history of virtual reality and how I got my fingers wet.
I will also write about what I experienced recently with my newly bought Meta Quest Pro and how I see the future of virtual reality.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-history">2. History</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first virtual reality device was the first loudspeaker headset limited to audio senses, but the term was not used for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first virtual reality device, called virtual reality, was the Sensorama, built by Morton Heilig in 1962.
I had a set on my head in 1995 at an exhibition IFABO in Budapest.
I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation then, and we had a stand there.
My task was to show the visitors the virtual reality headset that DEC created in cooperation with Kubota.
If you Google the term <em>"Kubota Denali VR"</em> you may find interesting traces of history.
I had little time to try and play with it, but I was impressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was convinced that VR is the future and will be here as soon as 2000 in five years.
I remember this because I was young and "brave" enough to express this prediction publicly.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-1-derail-prediction-and-braveness">2.1. Derail: Prediction and Braveness</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are an expert, you can predict the future with a certain precision.
You are a visionary if you tell others how you see the future and are correct.
If you are wrong, then you are a fool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are young and at an early stage of your Dunnig-Kruger curve, you are brave enough to express your predictions.
So, I was brave enough to say that VR will be here in five years.
I stated it in a forum not smaller than the main central state-running radio stating Kossuth Radio in Hungary.
Nobody remembered it after five years, so it was not a big shame, but in 2015, twenty years later, the same guy invited me again to the radio to review my predictions.
It was interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had some good predictions, like saying that mobile phones will be ubiquitous and be a personal computing device connected to the internet.
But my VR prediction was off the rails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why is it important to mention this other than it gives you credibility when you admit your past mistakes in an article?
Now I see what I did not see then and why VR did not sweep the board.
In this article, I will repeat the mistake I made almost thirty years ago and predict VR&#8217;s future again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why am I so <em>"brave"</em> to do that?
Because I am old enough to be brave again.
Young people are brave enough to predict the future because they do not understand that their predictions may bite back.
Old people know that when the prediction bites back, they will not be there to be bitten.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Never trust the prediction of a young or an old expert.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-current-experiences">3. Current Experiences</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I bought my first VR headset in 2017.
It was a Sony Playstation VR.
It was a birthday present from me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At that time, I saw the state of VR as mainly a plaything.
Gaming and entertainment.
I had some play with Fruit Ninja and Beat Saber.
I tried some other games but got dizzy very soon, and I realized why I was wrong in 1995.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technology for the VR headset was not good enough.
It lacked resolution, was too expensive, and needed improvement in tracking the head movement and lag of screen refresh.
Lag is very important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When, for example, you tilt your head and the world you see tilts with your head for a moment and then gets back to its state to make the horizon horizontal again, you get dizzy.
The lag is the time between your head&#8217;s movement and the picture on the screen.
The lag does not need to be large enough to be consciously recognizable, and it may still make you dizzy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the virtual world is dynamic, like car racing, your balance organ, the vestibular system, gets confused.
You see the car and the world around you running, but you are stationary.
That is what makes you really vomit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parts of these problems can be solved, others not.
In 1995, even in a static environment, I got easily dizzy.
Today, it is much better, and (jumping a bit ahead) I can spend hours working in VR, watching virtual screens in a virtual café.
As a matter of fact, I write this article with a Meta Quest Pro on my head, and I am sitting in a virtual café in Immersed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I knew this was not my last VR set, and I will have a next one suitable for work.
I was following the news about the vast investments of Meta and Facebook into VR.
However, I was waiting for Apple to come up with the next generation of VR.
I use a lot of Apple products.
They have superb usability and a hefty price tag.
On the other hand, if a senior engineer living in Switzerland who has paid off (never had) all the mortgages raised cannot afford the overpriced products, then who can?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Apple Vision Pro was introduced with the price tag of 3.5k USD, I realized I would not wait for Apple.
I could, but I do not want to pay that amount for something 1.0 and experimental.
I could also read between the marketing videos' lines to know that this headset may be better than the competition, but it is still experimental.
It is not Apple&#8217;s fault.
Although I expected a working version, I can see that this expectation was unrealistic.
It is not Apple Vision Pro that is experimental; it is the whole VR field, even after 30 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason, as I see now after experimenting with the Meta Quest Pro, is not technology.
Technology has developed enough during the last three decades so that companies can produce VR with good enough LCD, tracking, and optics.
It is the software that is immature, and it is in a unique way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you think about immature software, you usually think of software that has bugs.
Although the Meta Quest Pro certainly has bugs, that is not why I say it is immature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, there is no best practice on how we can and will use VR for work.
To develop that knowledge will need much work.
It includes those early experimenters willing to invest their time and effort in working with this immature technology.
It also needs a lot of money from companies like Facebook to develop the software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many software developed today will be thrown away in a few years.
Not because they are buggy or low quality but because they implement unusable use-case scenarios.
Nobody knows what is usable.
Do we want to navigate in a three-dimensional space with boxes and spheres representing different files?
Should we represent directories as boxes and zoom into them to see the files, or will they be lined up behind them?
Should we imitate the kinematics of natural objects in a gravitational field like in our everyday earthly environment?
Should we float in space without specific directions when we move between some abstract objects representing files, folders, programming elements, and relationships between these objects?
We will try; some people will like the first, some will be best fitting with the second, and others will prefer something developed we cannot even imagine today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I ordered my Meta Quest Pro, I was unsure what I would use it for.
I did not expect it to be ready for work.
I was hoping, but I realized that it may not be.
I imagined different use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work in a virtual environment with virtual screens, using Immersed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play games.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play some games, which are a workout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-meta-quest-pro-first-steps">4. Meta Quest Pro First Steps</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had mixed feelings when I got the Meta Quest Pro.
First of all, I had to wait a month till it arrived.
While waiting, I watched many YouTube videos about the device and the programs, so I was hiked.
Clearly, it was a mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After I started, it froze, and I had to restart it.
But it did not happen ever again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had to install an app on my iPad/iPhone to use the headset.
It is okay, but I had to Google it because the QR code on the printed users' manual led to a 404 page.
I deserve a seamless start for a 1000$.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It does not have a good tutorial.
It has a tutorial, but it is like someone had to write one to tick it off from the to-do list rather than one written for the user.
The usability and the guidance of Apple products spoiled me.
For example, there is a mirror in the virtual environment, which shows your avatar.
I did not get any information from the tutorial or documentation that it has a use.
I saw my avatar&#8217;s reflection, but nobody told me that I could customize my avatar if I clicked there with the virtual laser beam.
Later, I also found the menu system to set up the avatar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After five hours of use, I still could not figure out the different uses of the buttons.
After a few weeks, I know why: there is no convention.
Different applications use the different buttons differently.
There are X  and Y and A  and B buttons, but they have no unified meaning or use.
The only more or less fixed convention is that the shooting button for your index finger is shooting, and the trigger button for your thumb is grabbing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had some early bad experiences with the power and speaker loudness buttons.
As I was moving the headset on and off a few times, I accidentally pressed these buttons.
I had to learn muscle memory to grab the headset, a different way from what I first felt natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hand-tracking feature is amazing but not usable.
It is amazing because it works, but I had to switch it off when working in a virtual environment.
When I type, the controllers are not in my hand.
The headset recognizes this, and all my typing movements it tries to interpret as hand gestures.
Bizarre results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screen resolution for the virtual screens is usable, but they cannot compete with my two displays, 5k each setup.
I can see the pixels and the difference between the virtual and the actual screens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The keyboard use is also a pain point.
There are two ways to use the keyboard.
One is a so-called portal.
It is a shape fixed in the virtual space that shows the real world behind the shape.
It is like a window to the real world from the virtual world.
You can open a portal for the keyboard and see your keyboard blurry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem probably comes from the fact that the cameras were designed for tracking, not showing the real world.
I can see my keyboard but must adjust the light, and the picture waves slightly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other possibility is to use a so-called tracked keyboard.
In this case, the software identifies the keyboard by its shape and draws a virtual keyboard where the actual keyboard is.
At the same time, it draws your hands in real-time, so you see your hands and keys in a virtual environment.
It works as a labor experiment.
Only a few keyboards are supported: some Logitech models, Apple Magic keyboards, and Macbook Pro and Air keyboards.
Luckily, I have a magic keyboard, but I use a Windows native Hungarian keyboard layout.
Virtual keyboards support only US layout.
Not even Y and Z swapped for many European keyboards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must have a high-speed connection between the PC/MacBook and the headset to use virtual displays.
To have that, I configured my MacBook to use my iPhone interned via a tethered connection.
The Wi-Fi uses the 5GHz band and provides a dedicated hotspot for the headset.
With this setup, the lag between the computer and the headset is 6m; that should be enough.
Because I still could feel a little lag in the mouse movement, I ordered a USB-C to USB-C Oculus cable.
I feel ashamed to admit how much I paid for it, but it moved the latency to 2ms.
The mouse is still lagging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also had to switch to dark mode with IntelliJ for better visibility on the virtual screens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Watching movies is impressive.
And I did not mean the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8srG_iKh5Y">special movies</a>.
Just a good old boring Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc. movies.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-apps-i-used">5. Apps I Used</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried a few applications, and other than a few games I already used before, I categorize each application as experimental.
The most mature application is Immersed.
There are a lot of problems with it, but I use it every day for a few hours.
It proves it is usable, but to be honest, I am not absolutely sure if I use it because</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I really like it despite the drawbacks or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have buyer&#8217;s remorse and must convince myself that I did not waste my money.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I have experienced, though, is that meeting people in a virtual environment is much more natural than I expected.
When I do a video conference, I see the faces of the people I talk to.
When I do a virtual meeting, I can only see the avatars.
I expected it to be less natural, but somehow, it felt more in the present.
You are visually in the same space as the other people&#8217;s avatars; you talk to them, and your hands are tracked and shown, as well as your facial expression.
I also experienced that we needed less "who talks when" protocol than in a video conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also tried a mind-mapping application called Noda.
I do not use mind mapping often, but I wanted to see how it works.
I was surprised.
Using spatial representation of the mind map is much more natural than the flat one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also tried some 3D drawing, and I am still behind my plans with CAD for 3D printing.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="6-future-apps">6. Future Apps</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this is the chapter where I will make a fool of myself.
Let&#8217;s hope that I live long enough to see it.
I will not give exact year numbers when something will come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There will be a lot of technical development in the next few years, but that is something out of my experience.
I expect many steps forward regarding the software, applications, and development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right now, we have different applications that present virtual worlds and something in it.
Immersed does two things: 1. provides a space where people and their avatars are visible and can interact, and 2. provides virtual screens.
Noda, the mind mapping application, also provides 1. a virtual space and 2. a virtual mind map.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is somehow analogous to the MS-DOS times when you could run only one application on the screen simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I expect the virtual space to become the desktop.
It has to be provided by the operating system, and the different applications will be able to use it, placing and moving different virtual objects in it.
I have not read articles that envision this model, but I am sure this is how VR architects at big companies envision the future.
What do we miss there?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We miss the copy/paste and the drag-and-drop functionality.
I do not mean literally.
I do not think we should have a virtual clipboard and drag-and-drop virtual objects.
But we need a way to use different applications in the same virtual space and make them interact.
What we miss is the act, which is the most natural way of interaction between applications like drag and drop and copy/paste on the desktop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With that, I am sure we will soon forget the desktop and the windows and virtual windows.
Tethering a MacBook to a headset is like tethering a horse to a railway car.
It was needed briefly to provide the continuity of cultural development, but we will forget it.
We will have a VR version of programming IDEs; we will have 3D CAD, mind mapping, 3D UML diagrams, ORM representation, and so on.
These will run on the headset, and we will not need to embed the 2D desktop into our 3D virtual world.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This article is not about software development, but since most of my articles are about that, I expect that most of my readers are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What should you do as a developer?
What is the message?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, you must not ignore VR technology anymore.
The headsets become better and cheaper, and the software will develop.
Immerse, for one, can be a good excuse to buy a headset if you need an excuse.
You should get acquainted with the technology, what is available, and what can be developed.
Expect new operating system features supporting VR and new APIs and tools.
There will be many opportunities in the coming years around this technology.</p>
