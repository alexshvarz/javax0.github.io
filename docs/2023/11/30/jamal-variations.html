<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss Jamal at a JUG conference in Luzerne, presenting to an intimate audience.
Their engagement was evident—they listened intently and participated actively, posing several questions.
Some inquiries were particularly challenging, prompting me to confront the reasons why my pet project, Jamal, hasn&#8217;t achieved the momentum I had anticipated.
In this article, I will share the insights gained from this experience."</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="1-1-background-story">1.1. Background Story</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before diving into the main narrative and the lessons learned, allow me to share a related side story.
Although it&#8217;s not directly connected, it provides valuable context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the 1990s, I was employed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), during a time when the internet was still in its nascent stages.
Home connections were primarily made through dial-up modems, typically operating at speeds of 28.8 kbps.
To put that in perspective, downloading a 2GB movie could take upwards of 50 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DEC was developing a product capable of transferring data via the coaxial cables used for TV signals.
These cables, with their 6MHz bandwidth, were not only capable of carrying TV broadcasts but could also facilitate data transfer.
This method was significantly faster than the traditional dial-up modem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In December 1995, we showcased this product in Budapest, in collaboration with the cable TV company owned by the municipal government of district V.
Despite initial challenges with cable quality and noise interference, we managed to set up the system for demonstration.
Our goal was to highlight the impressive data transfer speed of 5Mbps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the demonstration, we chose to download a movie from one server to another, in front of an audience comprised of technical journalists and experts.
The presentation and demonstration focused on showcasing the speed of data transfer by streaming video.
We were pleased with the outcome until we encountered the first question:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you can transfer video over the cable TV?
Isn&#8217;t that precisely what cable TVs are designed for?
What exactly is the innovation here?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That question felt like a metaphorical truck hit us.
In our pursuit of technical excellence, we had overlooked the importance of articulating the business value.
Moreover, our choice of demonstration, while technically impressive, was easily misunderstood as redundant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This experience was a profound learning moment, one that parallels my journey with Jamal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-what-is-jamal">2. What is Jamal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before diving deeper into the story, let me briefly introduce Jamal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal is a software tool designed to keep your documents up to date, especially useful for technical documentation.
It automates the process of updating documents with references to the system being documented, allowing you to fetch many of these references directly from the system itself.
Essentially, Jamal eliminates the manual task of copying information from the system to the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its core, Jamal is a meta-markup language.
You use this language to specify:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The source of the information,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method for extracting it,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The insertion point in the document, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formatting guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The information source could be a file, database, webpage, or even a web service, though it is typically a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common use case is inserting a code sample from the source code into a document.
You define the file containing the code sample, specify the start and end points, and set the formatting.
This ensures that when your source code changes—whether during application development or documentation updates—you can refresh the document with a single command.
This method guarantees accuracy, eliminating the risk of missing dependent changes when copying modifications manually.
For example, if you rename or refactor a method for clarity, any related code in different parts of the document is automatically updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal is compatible with any markup language of your choice, being entirely opaque to the markup.
It has been tested with AsciiDoc, Markdown, and reStructuredText, and is even compatible with DOCX files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those editing in Markdown or AsciiDoc, the preview feature of your editor allows you to see the results in real-time.
For instance, IntelliJ IDEA users can benefit from a plugin that renders AsciiDoc, with Jamal integrated to work interactively.
Changes in the code are reflected immediately when you switch back to the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, Jamal integrates seamlessly with Maven, both as a plugin and an extension, and can be included in your JavaDoc.
It supports over 200 macros for various data sources and formatting options and features an interactive debugger to troubleshoot your meta-markup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have personally used Jamal to write my books and maintain this blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, Jamal is a technically robust, versatile, and invaluable tool.
Despite its utility, it has not yet achieved the visibility or momentum I had anticipated.
Let&#8217;s explore the current state of its momentum.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-momentum-of-jamal">3. Momentum of Jamal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Receiving feedback while developing an open-source tool can be a rare occurrence.
Users might extensively utilize the tool or ignore it entirely, often without providing any feedback.
Most of the input comes from users who encounter difficulties or are initially unsure how to leverage the tool effectively.
Ironically, if you&#8217;re seeking abundant feedback, creating simple software riddled with bugs seems to be a surefire strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another metric for gauging interest and recognition is the number of stars a project receives on GitHub.
For instance, <a href="https://github.com/verhas/jamal">Jamal</a> has garnered 53 stars.
In contrast, <a href="https://github.com/verhas/License3j">License3j</a>, a much older yet simpler project of mine, has achieved 531 stars.
License3j is essentially a library for managing electronically signed key-value pairs that represent software licenses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When considering a more recent project, <a href="https://github.com/sourcebuddy/sourcebuddy">SourceBuddy</a> has collected 138 stars.
It serves as a convenient front-end for the Java compiler API, illustrating its utility despite its simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these comparisons are made within the context of my own projects.
Drawing comparisons to behemoths like JUnit or Spring would be impractical, as Jamal operates in a completely different league and category from these widely recognized projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The disparity in stars suggests that while there is a need for tools like License3j and SourceBuddy, and they are indeed used, Jamal has not yet found its footing or widespread appeal among its intended audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why does the limited traction of Jamal weigh so heavily on me?
The answer lies in the considerable effort and expectation I&#8217;ve invested in it.
Jamal was crafted to streamline the management of technical documents, a solution born from my own needs and challenges.
It simplified my workflow significantly and enhanced the quality of the documents I produced.
Naturally, I anticipated it would offer similar benefits to others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The apparent lack of momentum for Jamal has become a source of frustration, prompting me to delve into the potential reasons behind it.
One hypothesis is the inherent complexity of Jamal.
Utilizing Jamal requires an initial investment of effort beyond that of traditional documentation processes.
Its advantages become most apparent in the long term, particularly during document maintenance when changes become necessary.
However, it seems that many projects settle for less-than-ideal documentation quality, a reality that is equally troubling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This observation is not just a personal grievance.
The industry at large recognizes the importance of high-quality documentation, yet often falls short in practice.
I am not alone in my concerns.
There is a growing movement within the technical community, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a>, advocating for a "documentation as code" approach.
This methodology favors markup languages over traditional WYSIWYG editors and integrates documentation processes into the software build cycle, aligning closely with the philosophy behind Jamal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the personal disappointment, the scant usage and feedback for Jamal present a pragmatic challenge.
Without user input, my ability to discern and respond to the actual needs of the users is significantly diminished.
This lack of interaction restricts my opportunity to refine and evolve Jamal in ways that would make it more valuable and user-friendly for its intended audience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-the-demo-session-in-luzerne">4. The Demo Session in Luzerne</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During a recent demonstration in Luzern, I had the opportunity to present Jamal to a group of technical professionals, primarily Java developers, some of whom I had met on previous occasions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began by showcasing the simplicity of installing Jamal for users of IntelliJ IDEA, followed by a tour of its capabilities.
I demonstrated how Jamal could seamlessly integrate a code snippet from a file into an AsciiDoc document, automate the numbering of chapters, lines, and pictures, and facilitate the repetition of text with variations through macros.
I even highlighted the PROG macro module, which introduces programming functionality into documents via a safe BASIC interpreter, effectively illustrating Jamal&#8217;s limitless potential.
Essentially, I positioned Jamal as a Turing complete programming language tailored for document creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The audience, comprising Swiss and German individuals, is part of a culture I deeply respect for its directness.
While some might perceive this communication style as blunt, I find it incredibly efficient.
It&#8217;s a reminder that their straightforwardness isn&#8217;t intended as an offense but as a means to offer clear and honest feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And clear, honest feedback was precisely what I received.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One German attendee candidly shared his view that Jamal, despite its innovative approach and technical sophistication, was too complex for his liking.
He acknowledged understanding the philosophy, the technical solutions, the syntax, and its optimization for document handling.
Yet, he concluded that its complexity was a barrier to adoption for his projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standing there, absorbing his feedback, was not easy, but I found myself in agreement.
This interaction, challenging as it was, aligned with the modest number of stars on GitHub, underscoring a coherent message about Jamal&#8217;s reception in the community.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-what-to-do">5. What to Do?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faced with the candid feedback about Jamal&#8217;s complexity, I stand at a crossroads.
Abandoning the project is an option, yet the very act of writing this article signifies my unwillingness to take that path.
The alternative?
To double down on marketing efforts to spark further engagement and to leverage the feedback received at the conference to streamline Jamal&#8217;s usability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remain convinced that the core structure and architecture of Jamal are as streamlined as possible, balancing simplicity with functionality.
The essence of Jamal, transforming input text into output text instead of modifying the text you edit, embodies the "Write the Doc" philosophy and Jamal&#8217;s foundational principles.
The distinction between human-generated source code, whether for programs or documentation, and computer-generated output is a cornerstone of this philosophy.
Introducing editorial tools that blur this distinction would diverge from the intended path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Efforts to enhance Jamal&#8217;s user-friendliness have been substantial.
Features like interactive editing, an integrated debugger, and compatibility with various editors and CI/CD tools were all designed to minimize the learning curve and maximize efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet, there&#8217;s always room for improvement, particularly in making macros more accessible.
Inspired by the conference feedback, I found myself working late into the night upon my return home, developing a <a href="https://github.com/verhas/jamal/blob/master/jamal-snippet/README.adoc#variation">new macro</a> designed for ease of use.
This initiative is just the beginning, and I plan to delve deeper into this topic in a future article.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With your support, I am committed to evolving Jamal, making it not only a powerful tool but also an accessible one for a broader audience.
The journey of Jamal is far from over, and your feedback is the beacon guiding its course.</p>
