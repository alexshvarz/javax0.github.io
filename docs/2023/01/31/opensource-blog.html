<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This article is about the philosophy behind creating an open-source blog.
The article will discuss</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>what an open-source blog means</p>

<h2 id="2-what-is-an-open-source-blog">2. What is an Open-Source Blog?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We know what open-source software (OSS) is.
It is many things.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>OSS is free to redistribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code is included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The license allows modification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports the integrity of the author&#8217;s code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against persons or groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against fields of endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distribution of license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License must not be specific to a product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License must not restrict other software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License must be technology-neutral.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition">Wikipedia, Open Source Definition</a>])</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initiative of OSS was extended to documentation, for example, the GNU Free Documentation License.
The most well-known licensing scheme is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license">Creative Commons License</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These mainly focus on the rights and the way the product is used.
It is imperative, and there is a good reason that most approaches look at this side of OSS and documentation.
This side regulates the use and how OSS creates value in the economy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, as a developer, the other side is more important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me use the well-known parable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">about the blind men and the elephant</a>.
Everybody touches a different part of the elephant and has a different opinion about what an elephant is.
The industry is mainly interested in the fertilizing output that comes out of the OSS ecosystem.
I stay more at the other end of the elephant, at the trunk and the mouth that feeds the animal.
I drew a picture of an elephant showing the developer side:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/elephant.png" alt="elephant" width="500px">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we create open-source software, we usually do it for fun.
It is why I was drawing the elephant.
It is fun.
In a commercial project, you never do that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, open source, for me, is cooperation.
We do it together.
There is a  team of developers, and we develop the software together.
Other people use the software, and few start to complain.</p>
</div>
<details>
<summary class="title">Four Levels of OSS Developer Success (click to open)</summary>
<div class="content">
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>You create a project, and no one notices.
It is always how it starts, but even this is fun.
Creating software is fun.
If it is not fun, then don&#8217;t do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have started to use your software.
You do not know about it because they do not give you feedback.
You google your project name and may see it mentioned, appearing at places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People start asking stupid and annoying questions.
It is the real success.
People believe your software is so good that they invest effort in asking when they cannot get along.
Your users are introverted developers.
From their side, asking is a considerable effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are hate posts about your software.
It is the ultimate success.
Some people write about why no one should not use your software.
I could never reach this level with any of my projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is when you start your OSS project.
When you join an already-running OSS project, it is different.
In that case, you jump on an already running train&#8230;&#8203; sorry: elephant.
Your name gets to the list of developers, and you can be proud that your tiny but essential change was added to the project.</p>

<p>What about blogs?
What will make this blog to be open source?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is open for collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code is included.</p>

<p>Blog content is free to redistribute.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-it-is-open-for-collaboration">3. It is open for collaboration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the most critical aspect of open-source blogging.
You can use the content of this blog according to the CC-BY license terms.
It allows practically any use, even commercial, so long you attribute the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But that is the rear end of the elephant.
We are interested in feeding the elephant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This blog is maintained in a <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Doc as Code</a> style.
The blog is edited using markup.
The selected markup is Asciidoc, and I also use the Jamal preprocessor.
The article source files are <code>.adoc.jam</code> files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source is maintained on GitHub in a public repository.
It means that you can look at any article.
Not only those which are already published but also the articles which are under construction.
You can also have a look at the history of article editing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Articles are created and edited for days, sometimes for weeks.
It is similar to program features.
Not to interfere with the already released article set, these article sources are maintained in separate branches.
GitHub allows you to list all these branches and look at what is cooking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, you can fork the repository, create new articles, and suggest modifications to any article creating a pull request.
True to the open-source philosophy, I will consider every pull request.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-source-code-is-included">4. Source code is included</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is almost evident in the case of documentation or blogs.
The source is the text itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, it is, but that is a mistake.
It is like programming in machine code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you code in machine code, the binary is the source code.
We don&#8217;t do that.
The reason: it isn&#8217;t easy and involves a lot of mechanical work that computers can do.
We program in high-level languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we document, we still create the documentation in "machine code" to some extent.
Maybe, the level we are in is not machine code.
After all, you do not edit a PDF binary.
What we usually do is assembly level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The better approach is to use tools to write the documentation at a high level.
Do NOT copy and paste the information from the documented system.
Write code that will do the copy-pasting, reformatting, extracting, and transformation needed for the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal does it for this blog, and Jamal source of the blog articles are available in a public Git repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/javax0/javax0.github.io">https://github.com/javax0/javax0.github.io</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the source of the articles, the source for the build environment is also in the repository.
You can use them to start your blog if you like.
Their license is Apache 2.0, as denoted by the <code>LICENSE</code> file in the repo root.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-blog-content-is-free-to-redistribute">5. Blog content is free to redistribute</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no technical blocker since the code is available as open source.
The license is reasonably permissive, CC-BY.
I even encourage redistribution.
As you can see on the opening page, I have an agreement for many years with DZone and JCG.
I also discussed with Baeldung, but their policy does not fit redistribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find articles from the blog on Chinese, Russian, and Hindi sites.
You can also feel free to copy, modify, and translate as long you follow attribution CC-BY.</p>

<h2 id="6-supports-the-integrity-of-the-authors-code">6. Supports the integrity of the author&#8217;s code</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the article is modified, you have to note it in the attribution so that the readers will know that it is a derivative.
They can easily see the difference between the original and the derived work using backlinking.</p>

<h2 id="7-no-discrimination-against-persons-or-groups">7. No discrimination against persons or groups</h2>

There is no need to say more about it.</p>

<p>It is the part that makes me a bit uncomfortable, but what can I do?
If you use the content of my articles to destroy the universe, I must be OK with it.</p>
