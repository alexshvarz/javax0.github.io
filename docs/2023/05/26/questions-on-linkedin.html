<div class="paragraph">
<p>This article is a rant about the questions that are posted on the Linked In Java Developers Community.
I see many times questions that are not well formulated, and the answers are not well thought through.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is some good in it.
Being brave to go ahead and publish may be a good thing, but there is also some bad in it.
I face candidates during Java technical interviews many times giving "typical" wrong answers to some questions.
The source of that is the spread of these false and half, easy to misunderstand information.
One forum for them is LinkedIn Java Developers Community.
Presumably, there are other platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What makes me really sad is that this community is moderated.
Still, questions of questionable quality are published.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My aim with this article is to raise awareness in the vain hope that this will change.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="1-examples">1. Examples</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, I will display and discuss two examples.
After that I will write a few words of conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="1-1-example-1">1.1. Example 1</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The very first question that I faced recently is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Which one of the following loop cannot be used to change the value of any element in an array variable</em></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The While Loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ForEach Loop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The For Loop</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can understand the intention of the question.
The author really wanted to draw attention to the fact that a simple for-each loop cannot be used to modify the array elements it is looping through in a naive way.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">1.     void testForEachLoop0() {
2.         int[] array = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
3.         for (int a : array) {
4.             a = 55; // does nothing
5.         }
6.         Assertions.assertArrayEquals(new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, array);
7.     }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As clearly demonstrated by the above example, when we loop over an array using a for-each loop, the loop variable is NOT the array element.
It is the value of the array element.
In the case of a primitive value, this is a copy of the value.
In the case of an object array, this is a copy of the reference to the object.
Which, indeed, in some sense is the copy of the value but not the copy of the object, rather the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we can do is to modify the object that the reference points to.
I can even say that if the value is an object (reference), then we can modify the object, hence the value.
For example,</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"> 1.     void testForEachLoop1() {
 2.         class X {
 3.             int value;
 4.
 5.             X(int value) {
 6.                 this.value = value;
 7.             }
 8.
 9.             @Override
10.             public boolean equals(Object o) {
11.                 return ((X) o).value == value;
12.             }
13.         }
14.         final var array = new X[]{new X(0), new X(0), new X(0)};
15.         for (final var a : array) {
16.             a.value = 55;
17.         }
18.         Assertions.assertArrayEquals(new X[]{new X(55), new X(55), new X(55)}, array);
19.     }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>will modify the field <code>value</code> in the object array.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Just for the shake of brevity I created an overly simplistic <code>equals</code> method.
Don&#8217;t do that in production code.
Don&#8217;t do that even in test code.
Creating a <code>equals()</code> method without a matching <code>hashCode()</code> is a deadly sin.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can say that blaming the author on the language and the precision is nitpicking.
Do not forget, however, that these questions are targeting Java juniors, who can be confused by the imprecise language very easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And as a bonus, here is another example that modifies the original array.
If you look at it, you may realize that this is the same as the previous example, just overcomplicated.</p>

4.             j[j[0]] = j[0];
5.             j[0]++;
6.         }

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="1-2-example-2">1.2. Example 2</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next question is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>What is the access modifier for an interface in Java?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>public</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>protected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No modifier</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At least in this question, there is no grammar error.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/linked-in-question-example-2.png" alt="linked in question example 2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if I do not know too much about Java, the question is fishy.
A modifier is something that modifies something.
Java is a well-designed language.
There is some clutter in it.
It could cut some things shorter, like writing <code>public static void</code> in front of <code>main</code> and decorating it with a whole class surrounding it.
However, if something is not needed, it is not there.
There is nothing like mandatory modifiers that you HAVE TO write.
There is no "general and universal" access modifier for an interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some answers pointed out that an interface can be public, private, protected or package-private.
Not any of the interfaces though, because only nested interfaces can be private or protected, and only inside a class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What the author wanted to ask, I assume, was the default visibility of the members in an interface.
That is public.
From the votes, as depicted below, it seems that three quarters of the people answered the question according to the intention of the author.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/linked-in-question-example-3.png" alt="linked in question example 3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a significant number of people said that there is no need for a modifier, which is also true.
By default, the members are public, and for a long time in the history of Java that was the only option.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-conclusion">2. Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asking questions is a good thing.
Usually, people ask questions because they want to learn.
StackOverflow is an excellent platform for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These questions, however, more like exams.
Professors ask such questions.
It is a profession.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ask an "exam" question, you have to be an expert in the field.
But that is not enough.
You also have to be precise and know what and how to ask.
You have to understand what the readers will learn from your question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel that many of these authors evaluate this latter assuming that all the readers will read the questions and also the answers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all: there is no answer.
People vote and hardly ever go back when the voting finishes.
The answer is simply the result, but no explanation for the details.
The explanation is in the comments.
Many times there are some good comments but also many misleading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It reminds me of a Peter Bruegel painting from 1568, "The Blind Leading the Blind".</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to ask a question: do it.
However, do it right.
Before publishing it for thousands of people, ask a few friends to read it.
If more than one misunderstands it, then you have to rephrase it.
If some of them give a wrong answer and then seeing the right one, they start to argue about the question and the correctness: the question is wrong.
You may believe that they are wrong and not the question, but you cannot change your audience.
You can change your question.
Your question can hypothetically be correct, but wrong for the given audience.</p>
