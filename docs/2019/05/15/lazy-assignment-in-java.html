<p>Programmers are inherently lazy, and <em>similis simili gaudet</em>, like when the programs are lazy. Have you ever heard of lazy loading? Or lazy singleton? (I prefer the single malt version, though.) If you are programming in Scala or Kotlin, a JVM language, you can even lazily evaluate expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are programming in Scala, you can write:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala">lazy val z = "Hello"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and the expression will only be evaluated when <code>z</code> is accessed the first time. If you program in Kotlin, you can write something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">val z: String by lazy { "Hello" }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and the expression will only be evaluated when <code>z</code> is accessed the first time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java does not support that lazy evaluation per se, but being a powerful language, it provides language elements that you can use to have the same result. While Scala and Kotlin give you the fish, Java teaches you to catch your fish. (Let&#8217;s put a pin in this thought.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happens in the background when you code the above lines in Scala or Kotlin is that the expression is not evaluated, and the variable will not hold the result of the expression. Instead, the languages create some virtual "lambda" expressions, a 'supplier' that the code will later use to calculate the expression&#8217;s value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can do that ourselves in Java. We can use a simple class, <code>Lazy</code> that provides the functionality:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class Lazy implements Supplier {

final private Supplier supplier;
private boolean supplied = false;
private T value;

private Lazy(Supplier supplier) {
this.supplier = supplier;
}

public static  Lazy let(Supplier supplier) {
return new Lazy(supplier);
}

@Override
public T get() {
if (supplied) {
return value;
}
supplied = true;
return value = supplier.get();
}
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The class has the <code>public static</code> method <code>let()</code> that can be used to define a supplier and this supplier is invoked the first time the method <code>get()</code> is invoked. With this class, you can write the above examples as</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">var z = Lazy.let( () -&gt; "Hello" );</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the way, it seems to be even simpler than the Kotlin version. You can use the class from the library:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;groupId&gt;com.javax0&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;lazylet&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and then you do not need to copy the code into your project. It is a micro-library that contains only this class with an inner class that makes <code>Lazy</code> usable in a multi-thread environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use is simple as demonstrated in the unit tests:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">private static class TestSupport {
int count = 0;

boolean callMe() {
count++;
return true;
}
}

...

final var ts = new TestSupport();
var z = Lazy.let(ts::callMe);
if (false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; z.get()) {
Assertions.fail();
}
Assertions.assertEquals(0, ts.count);
z.get();
Assertions.assertEquals(1, ts.count);
z.get();
Assertions.assertEquals(1, ts.count);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the multi-thread safe version you can use the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">final var ts = new TestSupport();
var z = Lazy.sync(ts::callMe);
if (false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; z.get()) {
Assertions.fail();
}
Assertions.assertEquals(0, ts.count);
z.get();
Assertions.assertEquals(1, ts.count);
z.get();
Assertions.assertEquals(1, ts.count);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and get a <code>Lazy</code> supplier that multiple threads can use, and it is still guaranteed that the supplier passed as argument is evaluated only once.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I said to put a pin in the note, "While Scala and Kotlin give you the fish, Java teaches you to catch your fish." Here is what I meant by that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many programmers write programs without understanding how the programs execute. They program in Java, and they write excellent and working code, but they have no idea how the underlying technology works. They have no idea about the class loaders, garbage collections. Or they do, but they do not know anything about the machine code that the JIT compiler generates. Or they even do that, but they have no idea about the processor caches, different memory types, hardware architecture. Or they know that but have no knowledge about microelectronics and lithography and how the layout of the integrated circuits are, how the electrons move inside the semiconductor, how quantum mechanics determines the non-deterministic inner working of the computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do not say that you have to be a physicist and understand quantum mechanics' intricate details to be a good programmer. I recommend, however, to understand a few layers below your everyday working tools. If you use Kotlin or Scala, it is okay to use the lazy structures they provide. They give a programming abstraction one level higher than what Java provides in this specific case. But it is vital to know how the implementation probably looks like. If you know how to fish, you can buy the packaged fish because you can tell when the fish is good. If you do not know how to fish, you will rely on the mercy of those who give you the fish.</p>

<p>I suggested a change and did not imply that it is the only way to go, for me it seemed more flexible.
In case 1 the caller on subsequent calls has no means to tell the difference between a problem and a valid calculation as null might be a valid value.
In case 2 if there are side effects that should happen only once and are repeated because of the exception then it is a design problem.
Case 3 does not allow a chance to recover from an intermittent error (like network problem).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both case 1 and 3 are closing on the error and does not have the flexibility to recover. If you go with the second variation you can still add some code around to get the more fixed solutions if that is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Btw both Kotlin and Scala implements lazy with retries on exceptions.</p>

<p>lorek, I know you from a long time ago. I can assure you, that you are not a bad programmer. If you said that in the field of programming I am more of an expert I accept that. There are other knowledge areas where you excel more. For example quantum mechanics. I am absolutely sure that you know more about the characteristics of the distribution function of the electrons in a covalently binding hydrogen molecule than what I know.</p>

<p>Knowledge and experience in a specific area is not an absolute value.</p>

<p>I am happy that you still keep reading my blogs. By the way, this also shows that you are not a bad programmer. A bad programmer by accident may read some of my articles, but no bad programmer would keep reading them all, and I know you do. Appreciate.</p>

<p>I am not sure how Kotlin or Scala handles it but in your solution if supplier throws an exception then Lazy starts to return null values instead of trying again. I would suggest to set supplied to true only after getting the result to avoid this.</p>

<p>Well, this is a non-defined functionality that can be imagined in many different ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The current implementation will just return null for all subsequent calls, which makes sense because the value was not set.</p>

<p>Your proposed behavior would repeatedly try to call the supplier that will trigger the side effects so many times as many times the method get() is invoked.</p>
