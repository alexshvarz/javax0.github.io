<p>Recently I had a little surprise. It started me compiling some Java class and it did not work the way I expected. This is not the surprise itself: this is just the way I live. Develop, debug, release cycles. So the development cycle started. I was looking to find a bug in my code and as I tightened the bug boundary it came down to a ternary operator. The following sample demonstrates the situation:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class Bug{
    public static Number q(Number in) {
        return in instanceof Long ? 1L : 1.0;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was supposed to return a <code>Long</code> or a <code>Double</code> value of one, depending on the type of the argument. However the method returned a 1.0 <code>Double</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I looked at the code generated by javac using the javap disassembler and I saw that the case is really the one I explained above:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">public static java.lang.Number q(java.lang.Number);
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=2, locals=1, args_size=1
         0: aload_0
         1: instanceof    #2                  // class java/lang/Long
         4: ifeq          11
         7: dconst_1
         8: goto          12
        11: dconst_1
        12: invokestatic  #3                  // Method java/lang/Double.valueOf:(D)Ljava/lang/Double;
        15: areturn</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter what type the argument has, the code loads a constant <code>Double</code> on the operational stack executing the bytecode (<code>dconst_1</code>). This code is not good. But it does not mean that there is a bug in the javac compiler. This is not a bug, this is a feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing I consulted was the Java language specification. You can read it from the URL <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/index.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/index.html</a> and it talks about the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.25">ternary operator</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Otherwise, if the second and third operands have types that are convertible (ยง5.1.8) to numeric types, then there are several cases: </em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Otherwise, binary numeric promotion (ยง5.6.2) is applied to the operand types, and the type of the conditional expression is the promoted type of the second and third operands.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our case numeric promotion happens according to ยง5.6.2 :</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>If either operand is of type double, the other is converted to double.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It explains why this code above is useless. in situations like that use the good old 'if' 'then' 'else' construct.</p>

<p>You can cast it to Number, and this will work well:
