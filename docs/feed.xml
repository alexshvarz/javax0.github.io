&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently discussed how we use Co-Pilot and ChatGPT for programming with some of my senior colleagues.
We discussed our experiences, how and when it helps, and what to expect from it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will shortly write about what I imagine the future of programming with AI will be.
This is not about what AI will do in programming in the future.
I have no idea about that, and based on my mood, I either look forward amazed or in fear.
This article is more about how we, programmers, will do our work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-past&quot;&gt;2. The past&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To predict the future, we have to understand the past.
If you know only the current state, you cannot reliably extrapolate.
Extrapolation needs at least two points and knowledge about the speed of change in the future (maximum and minimum of the derivative function).
So, here we go, looking a bit at the past, focusing on the aspects that I feel are mainly important to predict how we will work in the future with AI in programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1-machine-code&quot;&gt;2.1. Machine Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When computers were first introduced, we programmed them in machine code.
This sentence should read, &quot;your father/mother programmed them in machine code&quot;, for most of you.
I had the luck to program a Polish clone of the PDP-11 in machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a program, we used assembly language.
We wrote that on a piece of checkerboard paper(and then we typed it in).
No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
As I write this article, Co-Pilot is switched on, suggesting the sentences&apos; ends.
In 10% of the cases, I accept the suggestion.
Co-Pilot suggested the part between ( and ) in the last sentence.
It&amp;#8217;s funny that even Co-Pilot cannot imagine a system where we did not have an assembler.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote the assembly on the left side of the paper and the machine code on the right.
We used printed code tables to look up the machine codes, and we had to calculate the addresses.
After that, we entered the code.
This was also a cumbersome process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were switches on the front panel of the computer.
There were 11 switches for the address (as far as I remember) and eight switches for the data.
A switch flipped up meant a bit with a value of 1, and a switch flipped down meant a bit with a value of 0.
We set the address and the desired value, and then we had to push a button to write the value into the memory.
The memory consisted of ferrite rings that kept their value even after the power was switched off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-2-assembly&quot;&gt;2.2. Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a relief when we got the assembler.
It was already on a different machine and a different processor.
We looked at the machine code that the assembler generated a few times, but not many times.
The mapping between the assembly and the machine code was strictly one-to-one mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was higher-level languages, like C.
I wrote a lot of C code as a hobby before I started my second professional career as a programmer at 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-3-close-to-the-metal&quot;&gt;2.3. Close to the Metal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mapping from C to machine code is not one-to-one.
There is room for optimization, and different compiler versions may create different code.
Still, the functionality of the generated code is very much guaranteed.
You do not need to look at the machine code to understand what the program does.
I can recall that I only did it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those times, we found a bug in the Sun C compiler (1987, while I was on a summer program at TU Delft).
It was my mistake the other time, and I had to modify my C code.
The compiler knew better than I did what the C construct I wrote meant.
I do not have a recollection of the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not need to look at the generated code; we write on a high level and debug on a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-4-high-level&quot;&gt;2.4. High Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we advance in time, we have Java.
Java uses a two-level compilation.
It compiles the Java code to byte code, which the Java Virtual Machine, JIT technology interprets.
I looked at the generated byte code only once to learn the intricacies of the ternary operator type casting rules, and never the machine code generated.
The first case could be avoided by reading the language spec, but who reads manuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true here: we step to higher levels of abstraction and do not need to look at the generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-5-dsl-and-generated-code&quot;&gt;2.5. DSL and Generated Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as we advance towards higher levels, we can have Domain Specific Languages (DSLs).
DSLs are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;interpreted,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate high-level code, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate byte code and machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third case is rare because generating low-level code is expensive, requires much work, and is not worth the effort.
Generating high-level code is more common.
As an example, we can take Java::Geci fluent API generator.
It reads a regular expression like the definition of the fluent API, creates a finite state machine from it, and generates the Java code containing all the interfaces and classes that implement the fluent API.
The Java compiler then compiles the generated code, and the JVM interprets the resulting byte code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we look at the generated code?
Usually not.
I actually did a lot because I wrote the generator, and so I had to debug it, but that is an exception.
The generated code should perform as the definition says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-present-and-the-future&quot;&gt;3. The Present and the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is AI languages.
This is where we are now, and it starts now.
We use AI to write code based on some natural language description.
The code is generated, and we have to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from any earlier steps in the evolution of programming languages.
The reason is that the language AI interprets is not definite the same way as Java, C, or any DSL.
It can be ambiguous.
It is a human language, usually English.
Or something resembling English when non-native speakers like me write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1-syntax-free&quot;&gt;3.1. Syntax-free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the advantage of AI programming.
I do not need to remember the actual syntax.
I can program in a language I rarely use and forget the exact syntax.
I vaguely remember it, but it is not in my muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-2-library-free&quot;&gt;3.2. Library-free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also help me with my usual programming tasks.
Something that was written by other people many times before.
It has it in its memory, and it can help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional programming languages have it, but with a limited scope.
There are language constructs for the usual data structures and algorithms.
There are libraries for the usual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you have to remember the one to use it.
Sometimes, writing a few lines is easier than finding the library and the function that does it.
It is the same philosophy as the Unix command line versus VMS.
(You may not know VMS. It was the OS of the VAX VMS and Alpha machines from DEC.)
If you needed to do something in VMS, there was a command for it.
In Unix, you had simpler commands, but you could combine them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AI programming, you can write down what you want using natural language, and the AI will find the code fragments in its memory that fit the best and adapt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-3-ai-language&quot;&gt;3.3. AI Language&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, AI is generating and helping to write the code.
In the future, we will tell the AI what to do, and it will execute it for us.
We may not need to care about the data structure it stores the data or algorithms it applies to manage those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we think of databases when we talk about structured data.
That is because databases are the tools to support the limited functionality a computer can manage.
Before the computers, we just told the accountant to calculate the last year, whatever profit, balance sheet, whatnot, and they did.
The data was on paper, and the managers did not care how they were organized.
It was expensive because accountants are expensive.
The intelligence they applied, extracting data from the different paper-based documents, was their strong point; calculation was just a mechanical task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers came, and they were strong doing the calculations.
They were weak in extracting data from the documents.
The solution was to organize the data into databases.
It needed more processing on the input, but it was still cheaper than having accountants do the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AI, computers can do calculations and extract data from documents.
If it can be done cheaply, there is no reason any more to keep the data in a structured way.
It can get structured when we need them for a calculation on the fly.
The advantage is that we can do any calculation, and we may not face the issue that the data structure is unsuitable for the calculation we need.
We just tell the AI program using natural language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a new patient coming to the practice?
Just tell the program all the data, and it will remember like an assistant with unlimited memory who never forgets.
Do you want to know when a patient last visited?
Just ask the program.
You do not need to care how the artificial simulated neurons store the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly will use more computing power and energy than a well-tuned database, but on the other hand, it will have higher flexibility, and the development cost will be significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when we will talk to the computers, which will help us universally.
I am not shy about predicting this future because it will come when I will not be around anymore.
But what should we expect in the near future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-4-the-near-future&quot;&gt;3.4. The near future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, AI tools are interactive.
We write some comments or code, and the AI generates the code for us, which is the story&amp;#8217;s end.
From that point on, our &quot;source code&quot; is the generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can feel from the previous sentence the contradiction.
It is like if we would write the code in Java once, then compile it into byte code, and then use the byte code to maintain it.
We do not do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is what we write.
Generated code is never source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect meta-programming tools for various existing languages to extend them.
You insert some meta-code (presumably into comments) into your application, and the tool will generate the code for you.
However, the generated code is generated and not the source.
You do not touch it.
If you need to maintain the application, modify the comment, and the tool will generate the code again.
It will be similar to what Java::Geci is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You insert some comments into your code, and the code generator inserts the generated code into the editor-fold block following the comment.
Java::Geci currently does not have an AI-based code generator, or at least I do not know about any.
It is an open-source framework for code generators; anyone could write a code generator utilizing AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later languages will include the possibility from the start.
These languages will be some kind of hybrid solution.
There will be some code described by human language, probably describing business logic, and some technical parts more like a conventional programming language.
It is similar to how we apply DSL today, with the difference that the DSL will be AI-processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time goes forward, the AI part will grow, and the conventional programming part will shrink to the point when it will disappear from the application code.
However, it will remain in the frameworks and AI tools, just like today&amp;#8217;s machine code and assembly.
Nobody codes in assembly anymore, but wait?
There are still people who do.
Those who write the code generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who will still maintain 200 years from now in the future the IBM mainframe assembly and COBOL programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-conclusion-and-takeaway&quot;&gt;4. Conclusion and Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually write a conclusion and a takeaway at the end of the article.
So I do it now.
That is all, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual reality is a technology when you wear some device projecting a non-existent world into your senses.
This way, you partially or completely lose the connection to the real world and are immersed in the virtual world.
Current technology does not allow a complete loss of connection to the real world, and the senses are mainly limited to vision and hearing.
Usually, two LCD devices with special optics are mounted on your head, and different sensors track your head movement.
The computers display pictures on the LCDs that change as you move your head, showing a static or dynamic virtual reality around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will write about the history of virtual reality and how I got my fingers wet.
I will also write about what I experienced recently with my newly bought Meta Quest Pro and how I see the future of virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-history&quot;&gt;2. History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first virtual reality device was the first loudspeaker headset limited to audio senses, but the term was not used for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first virtual reality device, called virtual reality, was the Sensorama, built by Morton Heilig in 1962.
I had a set on my head in 1995 at an exhibition IFABO in Budapest.
I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation then, and we had a stand there.
My task was to show the visitors the virtual reality headset that DEC created in cooperation with Kubota.
If you Google the term &lt;em&gt;&quot;Kubota Denali VR&quot;&lt;/em&gt; you may find interesting traces of history.
I had little time to try and play with it, but I was impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was convinced that VR is the future and will be here as soon as 2000 in five years.
I remember this because I was young and &quot;brave&quot; enough to express this prediction publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1-derail-prediction-and-braveness&quot;&gt;2.1. Derail: Prediction and Braveness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are an expert, you can predict the future with a certain precision.
You are a visionary if you tell others how you see the future and are correct.
If you are wrong, then you are a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are young and at an early stage of your Dunnig-Kruger curve, you are brave enough to express your predictions.
So, I was brave enough to say that VR will be here in five years.
I stated it in a forum not smaller than the main central state-running radio stating Kossuth Radio in Hungary.
Nobody remembered it after five years, so it was not a big shame, but in 2015, twenty years later, the same guy invited me again to the radio to review my predictions.
It was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some good predictions, like saying that mobile phones will be ubiquitous and be a personal computing device connected to the internet.
But my VR prediction was off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to mention this other than it gives you credibility when you admit your past mistakes in an article?
Now I see what I did not see then and why VR did not sweep the board.
In this article, I will repeat the mistake I made almost thirty years ago and predict VR&amp;#8217;s future again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I so &lt;em&gt;&quot;brave&quot;&lt;/em&gt; to do that?
Because I am old enough to be brave again.
Young people are brave enough to predict the future because they do not understand that their predictions may bite back.
Old people know that when the prediction bites back, they will not be there to be bitten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never trust the prediction of a young or an old expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-current-experiences&quot;&gt;3. Current Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first VR headset in 2017.
It was a Sony Playstation VR.
It was a birthday present from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I saw the state of VR as mainly a plaything.
Gaming and entertainment.
I had some play with Fruit Ninja and Beat Saber.
I tried some other games but got dizzy very soon, and I realized why I was wrong in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology for the VR headset was not good enough.
It lacked resolution, was too expensive, and needed improvement in tracking the head movement and lag of screen refresh.
Lag is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, for example, you tilt your head and the world you see tilts with your head for a moment and then gets back to its state to make the horizon horizontal again, you get dizzy.
The lag is the time between your head&amp;#8217;s movement and the picture on the screen.
The lag does not need to be large enough to be consciously recognizable, and it may still make you dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the virtual world is dynamic, like car racing, your balance organ, the vestibular system, gets confused.
You see the car and the world around you running, but you are stationary.
That is what makes you really vomit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of these problems can be solved, others not.
In 1995, even in a static environment, I got easily dizzy.
Today, it is much better, and (jumping a bit ahead) I can spend hours working in VR, watching virtual screens in a virtual café.
As a matter of fact, I write this article with a Meta Quest Pro on my head, and I am sitting in a virtual café in Immersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew this was not my last VR set, and I will have a next one suitable for work.
I was following the news about the vast investments of Meta and Facebook into VR.
However, I was waiting for Apple to come up with the next generation of VR.
I use a lot of Apple products.
They have superb usability and a hefty price tag.
On the other hand, if a senior engineer living in Switzerland who has paid off (never had) all the mortgages raised cannot afford the overpriced products, then who can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Apple Vision Pro was introduced with the price tag of 3.5k USD, I realized I would not wait for Apple.
I could, but I do not want to pay that amount for something 1.0 and experimental.
I could also read between the marketing videos&apos; lines to know that this headset may be better than the competition, but it is still experimental.
It is not Apple&amp;#8217;s fault.
Although I expected a working version, I can see that this expectation was unrealistic.
It is not Apple Vision Pro that is experimental; it is the whole VR field, even after 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason, as I see now after experimenting with the Meta Quest Pro, is not technology.
Technology has developed enough during the last three decades so that companies can produce VR with good enough LCD, tracking, and optics.
It is the software that is immature, and it is in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about immature software, you usually think of software that has bugs.
Although the Meta Quest Pro certainly has bugs, that is not why I say it is immature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no best practice on how we can and will use VR for work.
To develop that knowledge will need much work.
It includes those early experimenters willing to invest their time and effort in working with this immature technology.
It also needs a lot of money from companies like Facebook to develop the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many software developed today will be thrown away in a few years.
Not because they are buggy or low quality but because they implement unusable use-case scenarios.
Nobody knows what is usable.
Do we want to navigate in a three-dimensional space with boxes and spheres representing different files?
Should we represent directories as boxes and zoom into them to see the files, or will they be lined up behind them?
Should we imitate the kinematics of natural objects in a gravitational field like in our everyday earthly environment?
Should we float in space without specific directions when we move between some abstract objects representing files, folders, programming elements, and relationships between these objects?
We will try; some people will like the first, some will be best fitting with the second, and others will prefer something developed we cannot even imagine today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I ordered my Meta Quest Pro, I was unsure what I would use it for.
I did not expect it to be ready for work.
I was hoping, but I realized that it may not be.
I imagined different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work in a virtual environment with virtual screens, using Immersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play some games, which are a workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-meta-quest-pro-first-steps&quot;&gt;4. Meta Quest Pro First Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had mixed feelings when I got the Meta Quest Pro.
First of all, I had to wait a month till it arrived.
While waiting, I watched many YouTube videos about the device and the programs, so I was hiked.
Clearly, it was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I started, it froze, and I had to restart it.
But it did not happen ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to install an app on my iPad/iPhone to use the headset.
It is okay, but I had to Google it because the QR code on the printed users&apos; manual led to a 404 page.
I deserve a seamless start for a 1000$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not have a good tutorial.
It has a tutorial, but it is like someone had to write one to tick it off from the to-do list rather than one written for the user.
The usability and the guidance of Apple products spoiled me.
For example, there is a mirror in the virtual environment, which shows your avatar.
I did not get any information from the tutorial or documentation that it has a use.
I saw my avatar&amp;#8217;s reflection, but nobody told me that I could customize my avatar if I clicked there with the virtual laser beam.
Later, I also found the menu system to set up the avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After five hours of use, I still could not figure out the different uses of the buttons.
After a few weeks, I know why: there is no convention.
Different applications use the different buttons differently.
There are X  and Y and A  and B buttons, but they have no unified meaning or use.
The only more or less fixed convention is that the shooting button for your index finger is shooting, and the trigger button for your thumb is grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some early bad experiences with the power and speaker loudness buttons.
As I was moving the headset on and off a few times, I accidentally pressed these buttons.
I had to learn muscle memory to grab the headset, a different way from what I first felt natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hand-tracking feature is amazing but not usable.
It is amazing because it works, but I had to switch it off when working in a virtual environment.
When I type, the controllers are not in my hand.
The headset recognizes this, and all my typing movements it tries to interpret as hand gestures.
Bizarre results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen resolution for the virtual screens is usable, but they cannot compete with my two displays, 5k each setup.
I can see the pixels and the difference between the virtual and the actual screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyboard use is also a pain point.
There are two ways to use the keyboard.
One is a so-called portal.
It is a shape fixed in the virtual space that shows the real world behind the shape.
It is like a window to the real world from the virtual world.
You can open a portal for the keyboard and see your keyboard blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem probably comes from the fact that the cameras were designed for tracking, not showing the real world.
I can see my keyboard but must adjust the light, and the picture waves slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other possibility is to use a so-called tracked keyboard.
In this case, the software identifies the keyboard by its shape and draws a virtual keyboard where the actual keyboard is.
At the same time, it draws your hands in real-time, so you see your hands and keys in a virtual environment.
It works as a labor experiment.
Only a few keyboards are supported: some Logitech models, Apple Magic keyboards, and Macbook Pro and Air keyboards.
Luckily, I have a magic keyboard, but I use a Windows native Hungarian keyboard layout.
Virtual keyboards support only US layout.
Not even Y and Z swapped for many European keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have a high-speed connection between the PC/MacBook and the headset to use virtual displays.
To have that, I configured my MacBook to use my iPhone interned via a tethered connection.
The Wi-Fi uses the 5GHz band and provides a dedicated hotspot for the headset.
With this setup, the lag between the computer and the headset is 6m; that should be enough.
Because I still could feel a little lag in the mouse movement, I ordered a USB-C to USB-C Oculus cable.
I feel ashamed to admit how much I paid for it, but it moved the latency to 2ms.
The mouse is still lagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to switch to dark mode with IntelliJ for better visibility on the virtual screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching movies is impressive.
And I did not mean the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8srG_iKh5Y&quot;&gt;special movies&lt;/a&gt;.
Just a good old boring Netflix, Disney, Amazon, etc. movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-apps-i-used&quot;&gt;5. Apps I Used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few applications, and other than a few games I already used before, I categorize each application as experimental.
The most mature application is Immersed.
There are a lot of problems with it, but I use it every day for a few hours.
It proves it is usable, but to be honest, I am not absolutely sure if I use it because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like it despite the drawbacks or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have buyer&amp;#8217;s remorse and must convince myself that I did not waste my money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have experienced, though, is that meeting people in a virtual environment is much more natural than I expected.
When I do a video conference, I see the faces of the people I talk to.
When I do a virtual meeting, I can only see the avatars.
I expected it to be less natural, but somehow, it felt more in the present.
You are visually in the same space as the other people&amp;#8217;s avatars; you talk to them, and your hands are tracked and shown, as well as your facial expression.
I also experienced that we needed less &quot;who talks when&quot; protocol than in a video conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried a mind-mapping application called Noda.
I do not use mind mapping often, but I wanted to see how it works.
I was surprised.
Using spatial representation of the mind map is much more natural than the flat one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried some 3D drawing, and I am still behind my plans with CAD for 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-future-apps&quot;&gt;6. Future Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the chapter where I will make a fool of myself.
Let&amp;#8217;s hope that I live long enough to see it.
I will not give exact year numbers when something will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of technical development in the next few years, but that is something out of my experience.
I expect many steps forward regarding the software, applications, and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we have different applications that present virtual worlds and something in it.
Immersed does two things: 1. provides a space where people and their avatars are visible and can interact, and 2. provides virtual screens.
Noda, the mind mapping application, also provides 1. a virtual space and 2. a virtual mind map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is somehow analogous to the MS-DOS times when you could run only one application on the screen simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect the virtual space to become the desktop.
It has to be provided by the operating system, and the different applications will be able to use it, placing and moving different virtual objects in it.
I have not read articles that envision this model, but I am sure this is how VR architects at big companies envision the future.
What do we miss there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We miss the copy/paste and the drag-and-drop functionality.
I do not mean literally.
I do not think we should have a virtual clipboard and drag-and-drop virtual objects.
But we need a way to use different applications in the same virtual space and make them interact.
What we miss is the act, which is the most natural way of interaction between applications like drag and drop and copy/paste on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I am sure we will soon forget the desktop and the windows and virtual windows.
Tethering a MacBook to a headset is like tethering a horse to a railway car.
It was needed briefly to provide the continuity of cultural development, but we will forget it.
We will have a VR version of programming IDEs; we will have 3D CAD, mind mapping, 3D UML diagrams, ORM representation, and so on.
These will run on the headset, and we will not need to embed the 2D desktop into our 3D virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-conclusion&quot;&gt;7. Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is not about software development, but since most of my articles are about that, I expect that most of my readers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you do as a developer?
What is the message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you must not ignore VR technology anymore.
The headsets become better and cheaper, and the software will develop.
Immerse, for one, can be a good excuse to buy a headset if you need an excuse.
You should get acquainted with the technology, what is available, and what can be developed.
Expect new operating system features supporting VR and new APIs and tools.
There will be many opportunities in the coming years around this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I modified a feature in Jamal.
I kept the original functionality for backward compatibility, but I added a new feature.
However, the use of the old feature is deprecated, and it will be removed in the next version.
I also wrote in the document that version 3.0.0, which is somewhere in the future, will not support the old feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I ensure that the feature gets deleted in that release?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I describe what I did.
It may not be the best solution.
You may come up with better ideas, and you are very much welcome to do that in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following chapters, I will dig a bit into what I changed, to give some background and then the tests I created.
In the end, I will also tell you what I do not like in this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this way I will also reiterate the most important features of unit tests, which surely is discussed in many other places, but it does not hurt to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-feature&quot;&gt;2. The feature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal uses macros.
After all, Jamal is a meta markup language with built-in and user defined macros, so that is a core feature.
The macros are identified by a name, that contains &lt;code&gt;[$_:a-zA-Z0-9]&lt;/code&gt; characters not starting with a number.
This is fairly standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some solutions import text from some source where the natural name of the source does not comform to this rule.
To overcome this, there is a macro named &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; that returns a temporary alias for the macro named irregularly.
That way, instead of the syntactically incorrect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;{this.cannot.be.a.macro}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can be used as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;{{@macro [alias]this.cannot.be.a.macro}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macro &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; can create aliases for user defined as well as for built-in macros.
To get an alias for a built-in macro the option &lt;code&gt;builtin&lt;/code&gt; has to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;{@{@macro [builtin alias]this.cannot.be.a.macro}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old version used a different format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;{@{@macro [type=&quot;builtin&quot; alias]this.cannot.be.a.macro}}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;defining the type of the macro as a string.
As Jamal was developed the parameter options can now be Java &lt;code&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; values.
When you can select &lt;code&gt;builtin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;userdefined&lt;/code&gt; this is a better choice than using a string.
The part &lt;code&gt;type=&lt;/code&gt; is only noise with no extra information.
It is evident what &lt;code&gt;builtin&lt;/code&gt; or the default &lt;code&gt;userdefined&lt;/code&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameter option &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; will be deprecated in the next release (2.5.0), but should not be deleted.
It will be removed in the release 3.0.0.
Backward incompatibility has to be kept to minimal and is usually not allowed for minor version increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-problem-statement&quot;&gt;3. Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
The parop &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; with string parameters is supported for compatibility reasons only and is deprecated.
It will be removed in release 3.0.0
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I ensure that the feature gets deleted in that release?
When we need something to be ensured, the best way is that we write a test about it.
The tests run automatically for each build, and if the test fails, the build fails.
It is more or less a trivial idea to have a test for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-designing-the-test&quot;&gt;4. Designing the Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality of the test is fairly simple.
It has to check the version of the Jamal library and if it &lt;code&gt;3.0.0&lt;/code&gt; or higher than it has to check that the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that it is simple: we have to process a &lt;code&gt;macro&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parop, and it has to throw an exception.
Since Jama has a support library, you can easily write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;TestThat.theInput(
  &quot;{@define a=yayy}{#ident {@define a=value of a}&quot; +
  &quot;{@macro [global type=\&quot;user defined\&quot;]a}}&quot;).throwsBadSyntax();&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal can also provide the running instance version calling &lt;code&gt;Processor.jamalVersionString()&lt;/code&gt;, therefore, it is also not an issue.
The whole test is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;@Test
@DisplayName(&quot;Macro parop &apos;type&apos; is deprecated and has to be removed in version 3 and later&quot;)
void testDeprecation() throws Exception {
    final var v = Processor.jamalVersionString();
    if (!v.startsWith(&quot;2&quot;)) {
          TestThat.theInput(
            &quot;{@define a=yayy}{#ident {@define a=value of a}&quot; +
            &quot;{@macro [global type=\&quot;user defined\&quot;]a}}&quot;).throwsBadSyntax();
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the technical part, but I also want this unit test to be a &quot;real&quot; unit test.
Is it possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests have to be
&lt;em&gt;descriptive, fast, isolated, repeatable, small, self-validating,
maintainable, trustable, focused, thorough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to name a few of the qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Descriptive&lt;/em&gt; means that reading the code of the unit test makes it evident what the test does.
Many times this feature is mentioned as &lt;em&gt;readable&lt;/em&gt;.
In the case of JUnit it is supported by the &lt;code&gt;DisplayName&lt;/code&gt; annotation.
Looking at the unit test above this is hardly a problem.
We can tick this check box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; means that the unit test should bot take too much time.
This should also not be a problem.
The macro processing does not use any io, it is as fast as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isolated&lt;/em&gt; means that the test runs fine even if there is some bug in some part of the code the test is not responsible for.
If this test is isolated or not is debatable.
It is not isolated as it uses the test support library of Jamal, which indeed uses the processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that when this test runs, the processor is not under test and has to be considered as trusted code the same way as the mock library is trusted.
This is very much true when we test a macro library, which is independent of the core Jamal is tested.
A bit less when we run macros that are part of the Jamal library.
In this case, there can also be bugs in the processor affecting this test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a rare case, and the simplicity provided by avoiding the mock setup balances the cost of the possible bug in the processor.
It is how Jamal is designed and how it supports macro unit testing.
Also, this is a general engineering compromise between isolation and simplicity and has nothing to do with the fact that the problem is to test a future version.
Let&amp;#8217;s discuss this further sometimes in the future in a different article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeatable&lt;/em&gt; means that the test should run the same way no matter how we execute it.
It is isolated from the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small&lt;/em&gt; means that the unit test is short. It is very much related to the &lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maintainable&lt;/em&gt; quality.
If a unit test is large, contains many lines, it is hardly readable and usually not easy to maintain.
In that case, it is also a code smell that there is something wrong.
Either the unit test is wrong in some sense or the code itself needing some refactoring to be testable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the unit test is small.
It is three lines of code, or five adjusted to printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-validating&lt;/em&gt; means that there is no need to check the output of the test manually.
There can be no debate if the test passed or failed.
The output of the test is either green or red.
If it is red, then it can still be failed test or an error, which is also a kind of failure needing attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintainable&lt;/em&gt; means that whenever the code changes and the code in the unit test becomes invalid, it is easy to change.
Let&amp;#8217;s assume no matter how absurd it is that the syntax of the macro &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; changes.
This macro is used in the unit test.
If the change is so, then the unit test will fail, but not related to the tested feature.
It also shows that this unit test is not properly isolated, but I already discussed that and I will in detail in a further article.
The test, however, is maintainable because it is extremely easy to follow the imagined change in the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the syntax of such a centerpiece macro like &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; will not change backward incompatible.
That would be bad product management, but let&amp;#8217;s not derail: it was only a hypothetical example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trustable&lt;/em&gt; means that the test either passes or fails all the time independent of external conditions.
It does not matter if it is a hot summer, or cold winter, it is sunny or rainy, the operating system patched to the latest security patch, replaced by the marketing department from Linux to Windows: the test will pass or fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases when tests sometimes pass, and sometimes fail.
There is a popular extension of the JUnit framework in the JUnit Pioneer project that allows you to run the same test multiple times till it does not fail.
This is a totally wrong approach, and instead of being okay with having a test, sometimes passing, the developer should thrive for trustable test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not take it wrong.
A test that sometimes fails and sometimes passes can prove that the code is ok.
It depends on the code, the feature tested and the test itself.
For example, you can have a method that returns prime number to the number of seconds in current time modulo ten.
A test can check that the method returns 5 and repeats every half second till it gets it.
It is highly questionable what it proves when it passes, but failure does not mean that the code is wrong.
The test has to be improved, but if it cannot, then it may be better to have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test, I believe, is trustable.
Can you prove that it is trustable?
Questionable.
I will discuss this issue in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focused&lt;/em&gt; means that the test checks one feature.
If the test fails, it proves that one feature is faulty.
Beginners many times put multiple features in one test.
This makes it more difficult to see what feature is faulty when a test fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being focused is also expressed many times saying that one test should have one assertion only.
This is misinterpreted many times as one test should have one line of assertion code only.
This is not the meaning of the &quot;one assertion&quot; rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check in an assertion statement the length of a list, then in the next assertions the individual elements.
Technically, these are several assertion statements, but they compose one complex assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above test is focused.
Do not mistake the two conditions.
One is not an assertion, rather a prerequisite of the test.
Other than that the test checks if the feature &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is deprecated and removed in the future version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thorough&lt;/em&gt; means that the set of unit tests cover all relevant cases.
A single unit test cannot prove that the code functions as expected.
It can only prove that the code does not function as expected.
On the other hand, the full set of unit tests gives a fairly good approach and approximation of the correctness of the code.
It does not prove strictly to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this single unit test as a set, I can say that it covers all relevant cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-trustability&quot;&gt;5. Trustability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we said, the trustability of the example test is questionable.
So here we question and answer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turstability is a tricky feature of tests.
If you are a QA person, you know that nothing is tursted unless it is tested.
Testing the test is a great idea, after all that is your bread and butter, that is what you earn your money.
Unfortunately, or not so &quot;un&quot; fortunately that is also a cost of testing.
Testing the test is recursive and something having a cost attached to it must not run away.
Therefore, we usually stop there and do not test the tests with other tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What developers do&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what developers do.
I know what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I create a test for a feature, I run the test before developing the feature.
Then I develop the feature and then the test passes.
This is some basic form of TDD, and I am not always that disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If some strange way the feature is already there when I develop the test, then I just remove the feature to see that the test fails.
This is a manual test of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we do that in our case?
We have a test that checks that the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; parameter is removed and a precondition.
The issue is that the precondition needs a future release, which is not there yet.
It will be there as soon as the release will be created or when time travel is invented, whichever comes first.
,n of the Jamal library to a future version and run the test.
And that is exactly what I did.
And it failed as it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurray&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-takeaway&quot;&gt;6. Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed a simple problem and a simple technique to solve it.
It would not deserve much conclusion.
A simple trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I look at it as an example of some out-of-the-box thinking, we can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit test is a tool.
There are some rules on how to use it, but these rules are not strict.
They are not the ten commandments.
They are there to help us and must not be followed dogmatically.
We should understand why a unit test has to be descriptive, fast, isolated, repeatable, small, and so on.
If we understand the reasons we can judge better if our tests conform to the rule and also when to make an exception, when is it acceptable to break some of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I dedicate this article to László Fekete, my former boss and director at T-Mobile Hungary.
He plays a significant role in this story as he was the one who made the decision to cancel our contract.
I must acknowledge that he made the right call, and it was the correct course of action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, I also remember some instances where he seemed less concerned about his health, disregarding his blood pressure and cholesterol levels, despite my concerns, which we discussed a few times.
Sadly, László passed away in 2017 at the young age of 57 due to a heart attack.
It&amp;#8217;s a stark reminder of the importance of taking care of our well-being and not neglecting warning signs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, as I find myself at the same age László was when he left us, it serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the need to prioritize our health and well-being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 57, and I recently made some bad moves, and my back aches.
I cannot sit for a long time, and I suddenly had ample time at my hand watching YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my exploration, I stumbled upon an impressive channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen&lt;/a&gt;.
The creator of this channel is a remarkable young individual who possesses wisdom beyond his years.
His videos exhibit a profound understanding of technology, which captivates me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate how he simply sits and discusses other videos or articles without feeling the need to over-explain things.
It&amp;#8217;s a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; approach.
Those who comprehend his content gain valuable insights, and those who don&amp;#8217;t: sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoy when I understand what he says and feel that probably not many do.
It is a snug but somewhat arrogant feeling that one should be careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I could hardly find any of his statements I would strongly disagree.
Sometimes I feel we could have some discussion, but generally I can agree to, or accept his points.
Go and watch him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw a video where he was commenting an article that was about a story how someone almost accidentally corrupted PayPal in the early days.
I will not talk about that, it is here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzescXc5SW0&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzescXc5SW0&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a story with lots of technical details you can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being 57 does not only mean backache.
It also means that I have seen and done a few things that sometimes I tell younger people in the office.
Why not write articles about these?
So I decided I will write a few articles about things that I have seen and done and that I think are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I have time to watch YouTube videos.
I came across the video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f4fajEBqY0g&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/f4fajEBqY0g&lt;/a&gt;.
It is a short video about how to stop a thread, which you should not.
This is one minute, and it does say you should not, and a sentence why, but one minute is too limited to explain the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know why you should not stop a thread and not only what the documentation says.
It cost me 20,000$ in lost revenue in 2006 when the GDP per capita per year in my country was less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-background&quot;&gt;4. Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started programming in 1980.
My father was a professor at TU Budapest in Hungary and could access a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-30&quot;&gt;TI-30&lt;/a&gt; calculator.
It was a programmable calculator.
I remember I tried to write a program to crack an RSA encoded text published to be cracked.
Although the prime numbers were only 10 digits long, and the calculator had 1024-step program memory, registers were perhaps 16bit integers, and I had to implement multi precision arithmetic in my code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never succeeded with this one, but the exposure to programming &quot;infected&quot; me.
I was 14.
Later I programmed the Swedish ABC80, the Hungarian C64 clone, and the Hungarian VT-1080z that resembled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_(computer)&quot;&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; computer, ZX Sinclair Spectrum, and many others.
That time we programmed whatever we could get our hands on.
My Unix exposure was minimal because the chair I was volunteering had VAX VMS machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished TU Budapest Electric Engineer and started to work as a sales rep for Digital Equipment Corporation in Hungary in 1991.
Does not fit a programming carrier, does it.
That the time paid programming in Hungary was mainly crafting bookkeeping applications in BDase, and it did not pay well.
I was already married and had a child with the twins on the way, so I needed a respectable wage.
You can afford to live your hobby as a profession if you can afford it.
My priorities were different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept programming in C and Perl that time as a hobby.
I even wrote a small book in Hungarian about perl, which was the first such, and many learned Perl programming that time from my book.
So much that when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall&quot;&gt;Larry Wall&lt;/a&gt; visited the Budapest Perl conference in the late 90s, I was invited as a keynote speaker.
The title of my talk was &quot;Forbid Perl&quot;, and I was talking about how Perl makes you so productive that using Perl eliminates the need of too many other programmers, and therefore it has to be forbidden to be used for real applications.
I was saying that in front of the father of Perl sitting in the first row.
I intended that as humor, but after a few decades I see that I was right.
At the time, I did not see the benefit of professional software development overhead versus hacking something together in Perl.
It is not the trait of the language per se, but Perl usually was used to script things in a hacky way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left DEC in 1999 and joined index.hu as CIO.
It was a small startup, the first only online news site founded by a few university friends of mine.
We wanted to make history and get rich.
We achieved the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also programmed the advertisement engine of the site, which is a story on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the dotcom bubble burst, we had to lay off people, restructure the operation from investment oriented growing to sustainable operation.
There were a lot of things I learned there, but those were management lessons, not programming.
The last step was to give in my own notice, and I left the company in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started to work for T-Mobile, but they did not hire me as a programmer.
I had no prior professional experience and &quot;hobby programming&quot; did not count.
I was hired as a project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working in that position, I even ignited the development of a reformed project management methodology, but this was not my piece of cake.
Five years later, my brother told me to create our own company.
He was one sixth owner of a small company that was doing software development, and the other five developers moved towards SQL and stored-procedure direction.
My brother thought that Java development is more interesting and more prospective, so he wanted to start a new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why we decided to go to the Java direction and not Microsoft is again another topic that deserves an article on its own.
It was more political/philosophical than a technical decision.
I will write an article about that later, as well as about why we chose to trade in our old Linux and Windows machines to MacBooks with MacOS.
These are interesting topics because people approach such decisions based on belief, and it can lead to heated discussions.
Not now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the company in 2006.
One of our first clients was T-Mobile.
We knew the people there, they knew me, and they needed an advertisement engine.
I wrote the one for index.hu, and it was still in production six years later, delivering millions of HTTP responses per day.
Not only it was the far largest traffic web server in the country, but it was also the most reliable one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much later at a conference, a speaker said that back in the days they checked their Internet connection by pinging the adserver of index.hu.
Other sites can be down, but if the adserver is not reachable then it is more likely they have a connection problem.
He did not know I was sitting there in the audience.
It was a great feeling hearing that.
That ad server ran for nine years uninterrupted and without any code modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-thread-stopping-adserver&quot;&gt;5. Thread Stopping AdServer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we got the contract to develop an ad server for T-Mobile.
The contract size was around 30,000$.
I did not know any Java that time.
I had limited OOP experience.
I was mainly programming in C and Perl and not commercial.
But I was a good programmer, at least I though so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the application in Java while I was learning it.
The users were authenticated, and we had a backing database with user data.
The ad engine had to select the ads based on the mobile subscription, number of used minutes, phone type, and other parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used PostgreSQL as the database in the dev environment and Hibernate on a Tomcat.
An advertisement had to be displayed in two seconds.
If the selection process was running longer, then a default ad was displayed.
To achieve this, we executed the selection logic in a separate thread using the ExecutorService and waiting on a Future object.
We also used the database connection pool available from the Hibernate library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We manually tested the application, and it worked fine.
We ran some load test and it worked fine.
But I wanted to deliver perfect software, so I decided to play a bit with the case when the selection times out.
In that case, the request serving thread sends a response, but the selection thread is still running putting a useless load on an already overloaded system.
We can call &apos;stop&apos; on the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this scenario, and it worked fine.
The connection pool realized that the thread was stopped and closed the connection and created a new one in these cases.
I knew that the production will use ORACLE database and the connection pool will also be the one provided by ORACLE.
We did not have a test environment with these components, therefore, I decided not to use this performance-saving trick in the production system.
But I was proud of my code, and I did not want to delete the line stopping the thread.
Instead, I put it into an if statement that was never true, with a comment something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;// this &apos;if&apos; is always false but I keep it here to show that I know how to stop a thread
if( true ){
    thread.stop();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you already get a clue, especially if you skip over the line reading it not realizing that the ACTUAL value is &apos;true&apos;.
The code went into production and worked fine.
It worked fine for a while, except when the load went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the load went up, the application started to deliver the default ad.
The weird thing was that after the load went down, the application still delivered the default ad.
Operation had to restart the application to work again.
We did not have a clue what was going on, and we responded suggesting to increase the hardware capacity.
It was clearly needed to handle the peak load, but there was another problem eventually.
We tried to ignore it.
Being a small company, we were already occupied with the next project.
Putting new hardware under a service in a large corporation does not happen from one day to the other.
The service needed to restart a few times every day.
It went on between us and the project manager till he escalated the issue, and we could not ignore it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the log files, and we started to investigate.
The log clearly showed that the application allocated connection from the pool when a selection started.
The log also showed that the connection was returned to the pool when the selection finished even when the selection timed out.
I strongly believed that this could not be the problem, especially because we did not stop the threads in the case of timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that was what I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added more logging to the code, deployed it to production which essentially made it a bit slower, making the client even less happy, but it was needed.
There were log items for each request and response, we knew when a request timed out, the connection id, thread id and so on.
The log was huge, and I wrote Perl scripts to analyze it.
It took a week and a lot of diagrams until I realized that whenever a thread timed out, that connection ID never appeared later in the log.
The connection never returned to the pool, even though the library falsely reported that it was.
But why?
We did not stop the threads, and the log showed that these threads always stopped a few milliseconds after the selection timed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first clue.
It seemed fishy.
When the selection using a few SQL selects timed out, why was it always only a little bit late?
The fact that we first tried to increase the timeout from two seconds to two and a half seconds shows how clueless we were.
It made the time outing threads to finish in two and a half second plus a few milliseconds.
Always the timeout time plus a few milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Didn&amp;#8217;t you leave the code in that stops the thread?&quot; asked my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure, I didn&amp;#8217;t, see, it is in an if statement that is never true.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No. That is what the comment says.&quot;&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;he replied.&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;&quot;But the code is there, and it stops the thread.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at that code hundreds of times blindly during those past two weeks.
I read the comment and skipped the code.
I read what I wanted to be there and not what really was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I deleted the line and the comment, and we deployed the code.
It worked fine, unlike our relationship with the client.
They canceled our contract for the further development of the ad server.
We have lost a 20,000$ contract, and we were told that we will never get any contract from them again.
I could not blame them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;never&quot; lasted three years when partnering with another company, we delivered a system they used to electronically sign four million invoices every month.
Do you remember what my very first program was on that TI-30 calculator?
That delivery I am not ashamed of.
I learned a lot during those three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-1-dont-stop-threads&quot;&gt;6.1. Don&amp;#8217;t stop threads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you technically can stop threads, you MUST not.
If you MUST not, then why experiment with it?
You can tell the thread that it can stop if it feels so.
You can use some shared state for the thread to check periodically and stop when it can do safely.
Calling &lt;code&gt;interrupt()&lt;/code&gt; on a thread is a good way to tell the thread that it can stop.
Documentations list a lot of things that may happen when you call &lt;code&gt;stop()&lt;/code&gt; on a thread, but reading it is one thing and when it happens to you is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody has to burn the hands a few times.
The cleverer you are, the less you need to burn your hands.
There are some Mucius Scaevolas out there, not learning from their mistakes.
Do not be one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logs contain the messages that the application writes about what it does and not what really happens.
Programmers make bugs, including misleading logs.
Even when you use a high reputation library, you can still face bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-3-comments-can-be-dangerous&quot;&gt;6.3. Comments can be dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments can be dangerous.
Comments are in English and no matter how nerd you are, your eyes will read the human text first.
In this case, non-native English speakers may have a slight advantage.
If the comment is outdated, misleading or plain wrong, it may lead the maintainers&apos; eyes away from the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good comment does not explain what the code does.
The code precisely describes that.
You should explain why it does what it does and how other parts of the code should use, and interface the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case not having any comment before the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement, or just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;// we can switch experimental thread stopping on and off here
if( true ){
    thread.stop();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would have been better.
My today wisdom says to delete the line and the comment.
If you want to keep the line as a legacy, do it in a separate branch or tag in the version control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You do not know when you are there.
If you feel you are an expert, you know everything, you are the best: be very careful.
You are probably at that dangerous peek.
Don&amp;#8217;t stay there, climb off on the right side and start to climb up on the peek-less long slope to the right, always with a healthy level of self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the customer says that you are wrong, you are wrong.
They complained that the application does not come back from the overloaded state and our first response was to ask for more hardware.
Technically, we were right.
If the system does not ever get into the overloaded state, then there is no problem not getting back to normal from it.
However, you see how arrogant this standpoint was.
Probably this was the number one reason we lost the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned from this mistake.
We learned many more mistakes after that, and this is a process that I have not finished yet.
Learning from mistakes may be the most perpetual thing in my life, and I think it is important for everyone.
I have many similar stories, and if you liked this one then leave a comment, give some feedback that will make me know that I should write more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily use IntelliJ for the majority of my work nowadays.
This integrated editor and development environment offers numerous excellent features, one of which is the live templates feature.
I have chosen to assist Jamal with the implementation of live templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this article, I will elucidate the methodology I have devised for editing and maintaining the live templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-problem-statement&quot;&gt;1. Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ supports the editing of live templates.
It is designed to make the creation of live templates easier for beginners rather than being highly effective for power users.
Solutions and usability can always be designed to prioritize ease of use for beginners or effectiveness for power users.
Typically, these two aspects are mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of IntelliJ and live templates, it appears that the decision was made to prioritize the initial version.
To edit the live templates, you can navigate to the menu &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8594; &lt;code&gt;Live Templates&lt;/code&gt;.
The templates are organized by the language they are used in, and by selecting one or clicking on the plus sign to add a new template, you will be presented with a form to edit the different parts of the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/image-2023-07-05-11-40-53-991.png&quot; alt=&quot;image 2023 07 05 11 40 53 991&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the ability to edit several aspects of the live templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbreviation: This is the text you type in the editor to trigger the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description: A short text that appears in the popup when you type the abbreviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Template text: The actual content that gets inserted into the editor when the template is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context: Specifies where the template can be triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables: Parts of the template that can be edited when the template is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save a template, you can click on either &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;OK,&quot; and then proceed to add a new one.
However, when dealing with a large number of templates, such as the initial release that Jamal is working on, editing them can involve a significant number of clicks and mouse navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only challenge, though.
Maintaining the templates poses additional concerns.
Live templates are stored in ZIP files, and uploading them to a repository makes them accessible to users.
However, editing the templates and keeping track of changes can be tricky.
How can you efficiently make modifications to the templates?
How do you track and compare changes between different versions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers have become accustomed to tools that support them in maintaining program code, which is essentially text-based.
Similarly, we desire the same level of support when it comes to maintaining live templates.
How shall we reach that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-approach-to-solve-the-problem&quot;&gt;2. Approach to Solve the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The live templates are stored as XML files within a ZIP file.
It is possible to import a ZIP file containing live templates, which will add the templates to the existing ones.
Each group of templates is stored in a separate XML file.
If a group with the same name already exists in the editor, it will be overwritten by the imported group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach to editing the templates involves exporting them, modifying the XML files, and then importing them back.
By keeping the expanded files in a version control system, changes can be tracked.
The build process can generate the ZIP file from the expanded files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this process is not ideal.
Editing XML files is not preferred, as it can be cumbersome and unintuitive.
Nobody wants to spend their time editing XML files, especially when there are other enjoyable activities to pursue, such as going to the gym, swimming pool, enjoying an apéritif, or having a barbecue, or spending time with their children.
&quot;I am going to edit some XML files, what a joy!&quot; is not a phrase commonly heard (not to mention YAML!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need is a better solution.
We require a Domain-Specific Language (DSL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following section, I will describe the approach I took to create a DSL specifically for this purpose and how I utilized it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-suggested-solution-tools&quot;&gt;3. Suggested Solution, Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a DSL can be approached in various ways.
The most well-known option is to use Groovy, which is frequently used for this purpose.
However, Kotlin is also a viable choice.
Notably, Groovy includes an XML builder structure that facilitates the creation of XML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I opted for a different approach, driven by several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason is that the live templates I developed are specifically for Jamal.
Jamal can serve as a DSL and supports multiple integrations.
One such integration involves running Jamal interactively while editing an Asciidoc file in IntelliJ using the Asciidoctor plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this setup, you can also edit XML files.
IntelliJ and the Asciidoctor plugin will recognize the file as an Asciidoctor file, but Jamal will identify it as both a Jamal and XML file.
When editing a file with the &lt;code&gt;.xml.jam&lt;/code&gt; extension in IntelliJ, Jamal will save the processed XML into a file while simultaneously sending an Asciidoc document containing the XML as a fenced code block to the Asciidoctor plugin.
This allows you to edit the enhanced XML with macros in the left pane of the editor while observing the final, syntax-highlighted XML in the right pane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no separate compilation phase involved.
When you edit the &lt;code&gt;.xml.jam&lt;/code&gt; file, you are simultaneously modifying the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the DSL is remarkably simple.
You only need to define a few Jamal macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{%@sep {! !} %}
{!@define asciidoc:output=live-templates/templates/Jamal.xml!}
{!@comment This is a definition for the Jamal live macro templates for IntelliJ!}
{!@define template($name,$content,$desc,$variables)=
&amp;lt;template name=&quot;jm-$name&quot; value=&quot;{%{!#if /{!@string:startsWith/$content/#!}//@!}{!@replace /$content/\n/&amp;amp;#10;!}%}&quot; description=&quot;$desc&quot; toReformat=&quot;false&quot; toShortenFQNames=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;
$variables
&amp;lt;context&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;option name=&quot;AsciiDoc&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/context&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/template&amp;gt;
!}
{!@define variable($name,$default)=&amp;lt;variable name=&quot;$name&quot; expression=&quot;{!@replace `///`$default///&quot;///&amp;amp;quot;!}&quot; alwaysStopAt=&quot;true&quot; /&amp;gt;!}\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent conflicts with the Jamal plugin in Asciidoctor, the first line in the DSL sets the macro start and end strings to &lt;code&gt;{!&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!}&lt;/code&gt; respectively. By using these distinct macro delimiters, any potential clashes with the default &lt;code&gt;{%&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%}&lt;/code&gt; delimiters used by the Jamal plugin can be avoided. This ensures a smooth integration and usage of both the DSL and the Jamal plugin within Asciidoctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify the process further, the &lt;code&gt;asciidoc:output&lt;/code&gt; macro is used to specify the output file in the DSL.
Without this definition, the conversion from &lt;code&gt;.xml.jam&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; would create a file in the same location as the source file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;code&gt;asciidoc:output&lt;/code&gt; macro, two macros are used to define the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;: This macro is utilized to define the structure and content of the template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;: This macro is used to specify the variables within the template that can be customized when the template is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These macros, namely &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;, play a crucial role in creating and customizing the live templates within the DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the abbreviation (name) of the live templates always begins with the letters &lt;code&gt;jm-&lt;/code&gt;, which stands for Jamal Macro.
This prefix is used to avoid conflicts with existing live templates and follows the same practice as the Asciidoctor plugin, which uses &lt;code&gt;ad-&lt;/code&gt; as a prefix for their live templates (where &lt;code&gt;ad&lt;/code&gt; stands for Asciidoctor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the editing process and reduce the risk of errors, it is undesirable to manually insert this prefix every time when working with the templates.
Doing so would be a tedious and error-prone task.
Therefore, the DSL provides a macro that handles this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; element stores the text that will be inserted into the editor when the template is triggered.
The macro processing the content parameter is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{%{!#if /{!@string:startsWith/$content/#!}//@!}{!@replace /$content/\n/&amp;amp;#10;!}%}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Asciidoc file, macros will begin with the &lt;code&gt;{%&lt;/code&gt; delimiter.
However, just like the &lt;code&gt;jm-&lt;/code&gt; prefix for live templates, we don&amp;#8217;t want to type this delimiter every time.
Since these macros are not user-defined macros, they can be invoked using the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; prefix is used when there is no need to evaluate the content of the macro before the macro itself is evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; prefix is used when the content of the macro needs to be evaluated before the macro is evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; prefix is used to optimize computing power and for aesthetic reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
This notation was not taken from JavaDoc.
Jamal&amp;#8217;s first version, with this syntax, was designed in the mid-1990s, before or around the same time as Java was born.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid typing the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; prefix every time, a macro is implemented to automatically handle it.
However, in cases where the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; prefix is needed, we want to be able to use it.
To handle this, the content is checked within the macro.
If the content starts with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; prefix is not prepended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another macro called &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; is used to replace escaped new line characters with their XML equivalents.
This feature was not part of the initial version but was developed to simplify editing multi-line templates, as it proved to be a handy addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the macro string closing &lt;code&gt;%}&lt;/code&gt; is added to the template value to ensure proper syntax completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After defining these macros, the templates will have the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;templateSet group=&quot;Jamal&quot;&amp;gt;
{!template |begin|begin $M$|mark the beginning of a named or anonymous block|
  {!variable |M|&quot;[marker]&quot;!}
!}
...
{!template |platUml|plantUml ($O$) $I$ \n $C$|create a PlantUml diagram|
  {!variable |O|&quot;folder=... format=... template=...&quot;!}
  {!variable |I|&quot;xyz.svg&quot;!}
  {!variable |C|&quot;...&quot;!}
!}
&amp;lt;/templateSet&amp;gt;
{!@xmlFormat!}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the DSL, the &lt;code&gt;xmlFormat&lt;/code&gt; macro is used to format the resulting XML and also check for any errors.
With this macro, there is no need for a separate compilation phase to identify mistakes.
Any errors will be promptly displayed in the right editor pane, providing immediate feedback on the validity of the generated XML.
Additionally, the &lt;code&gt;xmlFormat&lt;/code&gt; macro ensures that the XML output is properly formatted, enhancing readability and ensuring a well-structured final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the editing process is ready, can zip the DSL, publish to the repository or import it into IntelliJ directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I have outlined a method for managing IntelliJ live templates using a DSL.
While it may not be worth the effort if you only need to edit a few templates, it becomes more valuable when dealing with a larger number of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway from this article is that the concept and approach demonstrated here can be applied to other applications as well.
Whether you have a binary or text-based dataset that is difficult to edit directly, you can create a DSL using Jamal to simplify the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By utilizing a DSL, you can enhance productivity and streamline the editing of complex templates or datasets, making it easier to maintain and update them efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal is an excellent tool for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back, I wrote an article about how you can add Mermaid diagrams to your Markdown document.
In this document, I will extend that technology and explain how you can add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;BlockDiag  BPMN️  Bytefield️  SeqDiag  ActDiag  NwDiag  PacketDiag  RackDiag

WireViz&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To your markdown, Asciidoc, or any other document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-problem-statement&quot;&gt;1. Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem statement is the same as in the previous article.
You want diagrams in your document, but the formatting tool does not support the diagramming tool you want to use.
It is an architectural problem that cannot be solved until we combine the different responsibilities: formatting and information content management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-approach-to-solve-the-problem&quot;&gt;2. Approach to Solve the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach is the same again; I am talking about the same tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is, again: the separation of concerns.
The document markup language should be responsible for the document structure and content.
The diagramming tool should be responsible for the diagramming.
The meta markup should be responsible for the integration of the two.
I will not repeat here all the arguments why this is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-suggested-solution-tools&quot;&gt;3. Suggested Solution, Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested solution is to use Jamal as the meta markup.
However, this time we will not use Mermaid as a diagramming tool locally.
Instead, we will enjoy the services of the diagramming tool Kroki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1-what-is-kroki&quot;&gt;3.1. What is Kroki&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kroki is a simple tool, and it is as genial as simple as the idea is.
It is nothing else than a web service implementing one &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to execute 27 different diagramming tools.
If you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create your diagram text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;convert the text to base64 encoded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;open the URL &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kroki.io/&amp;lt;tool&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;format&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;base64&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://kroki.io/&amp;lt;tool&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;format&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;base64&lt;/a&gt; encoded text&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you will get the diagram in the format you requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you develop something for open source, you can use Kroki for free.
If you develop something secret, afraid that your secret gets out to the internet, you can start Kroki on-premise.
Kroki is available as a docker image and also in other modes.
I recommend Docker if you do not trust the public service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we need Jamal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what happens if the service is temporarily not available?
Why should you pull the image all the time from the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-2-need-for-jamal&quot;&gt;3.2. Need for Jamal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first few iterations of editing the diagram file, converting it to base64, and opening the URL, you will realize that it is simple but repetitive work.
Precisely the type of work that should be automatized.
And that is what Jamal is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next release of Jamal 2.3.0 will come with a new macro, including a file that you can import as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{@import res:kroki.jim}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It defines a macro &lt;code&gt;kroki&lt;/code&gt; that you can use to include the diagram in your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this solution is that the implementation did not need any Kroki-specific Java code.
It was all already there.
The macros used in that file are available from &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verhas/jamal/master/jamal-snippet/src/main/resources/kroki.jim&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{@comment }
define the macro kroki to download the image from kroki.io and reference it either Asciidoc or Markdown syntax

{@define [tail] kroki($name,$dt,$ft,$x)={#if /{#string:equals/md.jam/{#file (format=&quot;$extension2&quot;) {@pos (top format=%f)}}}/![]({kroki:download |$name|$dt|$ft|$x})/image::{kroki:download |$name|$dt|$ft|$x}[]}}

{@define kroki:download($name,$dt,$ft,$x)={#define URL={kroki:url|$dt|$ft|$x}}\
{#memoize (file=&quot;$name.$ft&quot; hashFile=&quot;$name.$ft.hash&quot; hashCode=&quot;{#hashCode {URL}}&quot;)
{@ident {#download (file=&quot;$name.$ft&quot;) {URL}}}}$name.$ft}

{@define kroki:url($dt,$ft,$x)=https://kroki.io/$dt/$ft/{@base64 (compress url)$x}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macros check whether the included file is &lt;code&gt;md.jam&lt;/code&gt; (Markdown) or not; based on that, it generates a Markdown image reference or Asciidoc.
It also checks if the diagram has been downloaded and changed since the last time it was edited.
It downloads the diagram only if it has changed since the last time it was generated.
To do that, it uses the general purpose &lt;code&gt;memoize&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tooling also allows you to use variables in the diagram text.
Whether the diagram supports arithmetical, macro, or string operations does not matter.
Jamal provides it before the diagram text is sent to Kroki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mermaid is a trendy diagramming tool.
A year ago, it was integrated into the Markdown rendering of Github.
(see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/&lt;/a&gt;)
It is also integrated into several editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do, however, if you use a different editor?
What if you want to use your Markdown document in an environment that does not integrate Mermaid yet?
What can you do if the diagram is not Mermaid but PlantUML, Graphviz, or any other diagramming tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will show how you can integrate ANY diagram-as-code tool into your documents.
The technique works for Markdown, Asciidoc, APT, or any other text-based markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before anything else, here is a demonstration image, which was created the way I will describe in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/e8a96c341e35bf3594a44f6a47e198b17c60affc393db847a4e26f7ed05708b5.svg&quot; alt=&quot;e8a96c341e35bf3594a44f6a47e198b17c60affc393db847a4e26f7ed05708b5&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-problem-statement&quot;&gt;1. Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When documenting some systems, it is often necessary to include diagrams.
Keeping diagrams in separate files has advantages but also disadvantages.
It is easier to keep the consistency of the documentation when the different parts are close together.
The more distanced the two corresponding and related parts are, the more likely that one or the other becomes stale when the other is updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a good idea if you can parameterize the diagram, and you could avoid copy-pasting diagram parameters from the document, the documented code, or the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve these problems, more and more markup languages support selected diagramming tool markups to embed in the text.
You can include Mermaid in Markdown documents if you target GitHub hosting for your document.
You can include PlantUML diagrams in Asciidoc documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens, however, if you want to include Mermaid in Asciidoc?
What if you need PlantUML in Markdown?
How do you solve the issue if you want to host your Markdown elsewhere besides GitHub?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can abandon your ideas, stick to the available tools or wait for a solution.
The latter approach, however, will always remain an issue.
There will always be a new tool you want to use, and you will have to wait for the support of that tool in your favorite markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal reason for this is an architectural mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document markup languages must be responsible only for document structure and content and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedding a diagramming tool into the markup language must not be implemented in these languages.
It is a separate concern with the document&amp;#8217;s programmability ensuring document consistency automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to use a meta markup above the document markup.
This meta markup can be document markup agnostic and support all the diagramming tools you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-ideas-and-approach-to-solve-the-problem&quot;&gt;2. Ideas and Approach to Solve the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is not new: separation of concerns.
The document markup language should be responsible for the document structure and content.
The diagramming tool should be responsible for the diagramming.
The meta markup should be responsible for the integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the meta markup is language agnostic, it can be used with any existing and future document markup languages.
There is no need to wait for the support of the diagramming tool in the document markup language.
The only question is the integration of the meta markup into the document markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest and loosest way to integrate the meta markup is to use a preprocessor.
Processing the meta markup, we read and generate a text file.
The document markup processing tool catches where the meta markup has left off.
It has no idea that a program generates the document markup and is not manually edited.
Strictly speaking, when you edit a document markup, then the editor is the program that generates the file.
Technically, there is no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other possibilities.
Most document markups support different editors to deliver some form of WYSIWYG editing.
The meta markup preprocessor can be integrated into these editors.
That way, the document markup enriched with the meta markup can seamlessly be edited in the WYSIWYG editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed meta markup and the implementing tool, Jamal, follow both approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-suggested-solution-tools&quot;&gt;3. Suggested Solution, Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested solution is to use Jamal as the meta markup.
Jamal is a general-purpose macro processor.
There are other meta markup processing tools, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/&quot;&gt;PyMdown&lt;/a&gt;.
These tools usually target a specific document markup and a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal is a general-purpose, turning complete macro processor with more than 200 macros for different purposes.
These macros make your documents programmable to automate manual document maintenance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;quoteblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general saying is: if you could give a task to an assistant to do, then you can automate it with Jamal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal has a PlantUML module.
PlantUML is written in Java, the development language I used to create Jamal.
It makes the integration of PlantUML into Jamal easy, and PlantUML diagrams embedded into the documentation can be converted in the process.
Jamal, however, is not limited to using only tools written in Java.
To demonstrate it, we will use the Mermaid diagramming tool, written in JavaScript and running with node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Mermaid is not a Java program, it cannot be executed inside the JVM.
We will create our documentation to execute Mermaid as a separate process.
Other diagramming tools can be integrated similarly if executed on the document processing machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1-install-mermaid&quot;&gt;3.1. Install Mermaid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to install Mermaid.
The steps are documented on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaid.sj.org&quot;&gt;Mermaid site&lt;/a&gt;.
I will not repeat the steps here because I do not want to create a document that gets outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my machine, the installation creates the  &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/mmdc&lt;/code&gt; executable.
This file is a JavaScript script that starts the Mermaid diagramming tool.
While executing from Jamal, I realized the process has a different environment than my login script.
To deal with that, I had to edit the file.
Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; command to find the node interpreter, I specified the full path to the node executable.
Other installations may be different, and it does not affect the rest of the article.
It is a technical detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-2-install-jamal&quot;&gt;3.2. Install Jamal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use Jamal as the meta markup processor.
The installation is detailed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/verhas/jamal&quot;&gt;documentation of Jamal&lt;/a&gt;.
You can start it from the command line, as a Maven plugin, using Jbang and many other ways.
I recommend using it as a preprocessor integrated into the IntelliJ Asciidoctor plugin.
It will provide you with WYSIWYG editing of your document in Markdown and Asciidoc enriched with Jamal macros.
Also, the installation is nothing more than executing the command line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;mvn com.javax0.jamal:jamal-maven-plugin:2.1.0:jamalize&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which will download the version 2.1.0 we use in this article by the time pre-release and copy all the needed files into your project&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;.asciidoctor/lib&lt;/code&gt; directory.
It will make the macros available for the Asciidoctor plugin.
What needs manual work is configuring IntelliJ to treat all &lt;code&gt;.jam&lt;/code&gt; files as Asciidoc files.
That way, the editor will invoke the Asciidoctor plugin and use the Jamal preprocessor.
It is the setup that I also use to write the articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-3-create-the-macros-for-mermaid&quot;&gt;3.3. Create the macros for Mermaid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a mermaid document inside the document, we should do three things using macros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the Mermaid text into a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execute the Mermaid tool to convert the text into an SVG file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference the SVG file as an image in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, we will see how to save on Mermaid processing, executing it only when the Mermaid text changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the &lt;code&gt;io:write&lt;/code&gt; macro to save the Mermaid text into a file.
This macro is in a package that is not loaded by default.
We have to load it explicitly.
To do that, we use the &lt;code&gt;maven:load&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{@maven:load com.javax0.jamal:jamal-io:2.1.0}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This macro package has to be configured as safe for the document in the &lt;code&gt;.jamal/settings.properties&lt;/code&gt; file as it is documented.
The macros in this package can read and write files and execute commands configured.
To use a macro package like that from an untrusted source is a security risk.
For this reason, every package loaded by the &lt;code&gt;maven:load&lt;/code&gt; macro has to be configured as safe.
The configuration specifies the package and the documents where it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the io package also needs configuration to be able to execute the &lt;code&gt;mmdc&lt;/code&gt; command.
To do that, the configuration file contains a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;mermaid=/usr/local/bin/mmdc&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;line assigning a symbolic name to the actual command.
The &lt;code&gt;io:exec&lt;/code&gt; macro will use this symbolic name to find the command to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the macro package is loaded, we can use the &lt;code&gt;io:write&lt;/code&gt; macro as in the following sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{#define CHART=flowchart TD
A[Christmas] --&amp;gt;|Get money| B(Go shopping)
B --&amp;gt; C{Let me think}
C --&amp;gt;|One| D[Laptop]
C --&amp;gt;|Two| E[iPhone]
C --&amp;gt;|Three| F[fa:fa-car Care]
}
{#io:write (output=&quot;aaa.mmd&quot;) {CHART}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the file is created, we can execute the Mermaid tool to convert it into an SVG file, as the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{#io:exec command=&quot;&quot;&quot;mermaid
-i
aaa.mmd
-o
aaa.svg
&quot;&quot;&quot; cwd=&quot;.&quot; error=&quot;convert.err.txt&quot; output=&quot;convert.out.txt&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that, we have the file.
Whenever the Mermaid text changes, the SVG file will be recreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, whenever the document changes, the SVG file will be recreated.
It wastes resources when the diagram remains the same and the processing runs interactively.
To help with that, we can use the &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The macro &lt;code&gt;hashCode&lt;/code&gt; calculates the hash code of the text.
We will use the hash code to name the file.
Whenever the diagram changes, the file&amp;#8217;s name changes.
Also, if the file exists, it should contain the diagram for the current text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that the file exists, we include it in the document.
Because we do not want the SVG text in the document, we surround the &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; macro.
If the file does not exist, then an error will occur.
The macro &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; will handle this error, and the execution will continue.
However, the macro &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; will be set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in this case.
If there is no error, when the file already exists, the macro &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt; will be set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; macro will check the value of the macro &lt;code&gt;CREATE&lt;/code&gt;.
If it is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, it will execute the &lt;code&gt;io:write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;io:exec&lt;/code&gt; macros to create the file.
If it is &lt;code&gt;false,&lt;/code&gt; then it will do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jamal&quot; data-lang=&quot;jamal&quot;&gt;{#define KEY={#hashCode {CHART}}}{@define CREATE=true}
{@try {#block{#include images/{KEY}.svg}}{@define CREATE=false}}
{#if `//`{CREATE}//
{#io:write (mkdir output=&quot;images/aaa.mmd&quot;) {CHART}}
{#io:exec command=&quot;&quot;&quot;mermaid
-i
images/aaa.mmd
-o
images/{KEY}.svg
&quot;&quot;&quot; cwd=&quot;.&quot; error=&quot;convert.err.txt&quot; output=&quot;convert.out.txt&quot;
}//}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details using these macros, please refer to the documentation.
If you intend to use multiple diagrams, you may want to create a macro that does all the steps above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article discussed integrating Mermaid diagrams into your Asciidoc, Markdown, or any other markup document.
We selected Mermaid for two reasons.
First, usually, this is the tool people ask for.
Second, this is an excellent example of a non-Java tool that can be integrated into document processing.
The described way can be applied to any external tool capable of running as a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The samples also demonstrate a complex structure of macros showing the power of the Jamal macro processor.
Such complexity is rarely needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the technology, I discussed, though only briefly, the separation of concerns for document handling and how the document formatting markup should be separated from the processing meta markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have diagrams in your documentation, download Jamal, and start enhancing your documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is a rant about the questions that are posted on the Linked In Java Developers Community.
I see many times questions that are not well formulated, and the answers are not well thought through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some good in it.
Being brave to go ahead and publish may be a good thing, but there is also some bad in it.
I face candidates during Java technical interviews many times giving &quot;typical&quot; wrong answers to some questions.
The source of that is the spread of these false and half, easy to misunderstand information.
One forum for them is LinkedIn Java Developers Community.
Presumably, there are other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me really sad is that this community is moderated.
Still, questions of questionable quality are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim with this article is to raise awareness in the vain hope that this will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will display and discuss two examples.
After that I will write a few words of conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-1-example-1&quot;&gt;1.1. Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first question that I faced recently is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which one of the following loop cannot be used to change the value of any element in an array variable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The While Loop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ForEach Loop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The For Loop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
A simple grammar checker could also help a bit, but that is not an issue worth mentioning.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/linked-in-question-example-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;linked in question example 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand the intention of the question.
The author really wanted to draw attention to the fact that a simple for-each loop cannot be used to modify the array elements it is looping through in a naive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;1.     void testForEachLoop0() {
2.         int[] array = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
3.         for (int a : array) {
4.             a = 55; // does nothing
5.         }
6.         Assertions.assertArrayEquals(new int[]{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, array);
7.     }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As clearly demonstrated by the above example, when we loop over an array using a for-each loop, the loop variable is NOT the array element.
It is the value of the array element.
In the case of a primitive value, this is a copy of the value.
In the case of an object array, this is a copy of the reference to the object.
Which, indeed, in some sense is the copy of the value but not the copy of the object, rather the reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can do is to modify the object that the reference points to.
I can even say that if the value is an object (reference), then we can modify the object, hence the value.
For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1.     void testForEachLoop1() {
 2.         class X {
 3.             int value;
 4.
 5.             X(int value) {
 6.                 this.value = value;
 7.             }
 8.
 9.             @Override
10.             public boolean equals(Object o) {
11.                 return ((X) o).value == value;
12.             }
13.         }
14.         final var array = new X[]{new X(0), new X(0), new X(0)};
15.         for (final var a : array) {
16.             a.value = 55;
17.         }
18.         Assertions.assertArrayEquals(new X[]{new X(55), new X(55), new X(55)}, array);
19.     }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will modify the field &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; in the object array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
Just for the shake of brevity I created an overly simplistic &lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt; method.
Don&amp;#8217;t do that in production code.
Don&amp;#8217;t do that even in test code.
Creating a &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; method without a matching &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; is a deadly sin.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say that blaming the author on the language and the precision is nitpicking.
Do not forget, however, that these questions are targeting Java juniors, who can be confused by the imprecise language very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a bonus, here is another example that modifies the original array.
If you look at it, you may realize that this is the same as the previous example, just overcomplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;1.     void testForEachLoop() {
2.         int[] array = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
3.         for (int[] j : IntStream.range(0, array.length).mapToObj(i -&amp;gt; array).toArray(int[][]::new)) {
4.             j[j[0]] = j[0];
5.             j[0]++;
6.         }
7.         Assertions.assertArrayEquals(new int[]{6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, array);
8.     }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-2-example-2&quot;&gt;1.2. Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the access modifier for an interface in Java?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;private&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;protected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No modifier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in this question, there is no grammar error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/linked-in-question-example-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;linked in question example 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I do not know too much about Java, the question is fishy.
A modifier is something that modifies something.
Java is a well-designed language.
There is some clutter in it.
It could cut some things shorter, like writing &lt;code&gt;public static void&lt;/code&gt; in front of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and decorating it with a whole class surrounding it.
However, if something is not needed, it is not there.
There is nothing like mandatory modifiers that you HAVE TO write.
There is no &quot;general and universal&quot; access modifier for an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some answers pointed out that an interface can be public, private, protected or package-private.
Not any of the interfaces though, because only nested interfaces can be private or protected, and only inside a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the author wanted to ask, I assume, was the default visibility of the members in an interface.
That is public.
From the votes, as depicted below, it seems that three quarters of the people answered the question according to the intention of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javax0/javax0.github.io/master/assets/images/linked-in-question-example-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;linked in question example 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a significant number of people said that there is no need for a modifier, which is also true.
By default, the members are public, and for a long time in the history of Java that was the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is a good thing.
Usually, people ask questions because they want to learn.
StackOverflow is an excellent platform for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions, however, more like exams.
Professors ask such questions.
It is a profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ask an &quot;exam&quot; question, you have to be an expert in the field.
But that is not enough.
You also have to be precise and know what and how to ask.
You have to understand what the readers will learn from your question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that many of these authors evaluate this latter assuming that all the readers will read the questions and also the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all: there is no answer.
People vote and hardly ever go back when the voting finishes.
The answer is simply the result, but no explanation for the details.
The explanation is in the comments.
Many times there are some good comments but also many misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of a Peter Bruegel painting from 1568, &quot;The Blind Leading the Blind&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to ask a question: do it.
However, do it right.
Before publishing it for thousands of people, ask a few friends to read it.
If more than one misunderstands it, then you have to rephrase it.
If some of them give a wrong answer and then seeing the right one, they start to argue about the question and the correctness: the question is wrong.
You may believe that they are wrong and not the question, but you cannot change your audience.
You can change your question.
Your question can hypothetically be correct, but wrong for the given audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is about an algorithmic problem.
I did not find a solution to this problem either thinking about it, searching the net or talking to friends.
The problem itself is simple.
At the first reading, it may lure the reader into a false sense of simplicity.
You may feel that this should not be an issue.
But it is.
At least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing Java.
Nothing programming other than it is about an algorithmic problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an array of \(2n\) elements.
The array is \(A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_b\}\).
What steps should be taken to rearrange the array so that \(A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}\) with limited, maximum \(O(1)\) memory, and \(O(n)\) time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sine generative AI is sweeping the media and the internet; I thought that I should try to use it to solve the problem.
After all, if it takes my job just in a few years, at least we can let it do some work for us till then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the answer, no surprise: totally wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Wrong answer from ChapGPT&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To rearrange the array \(A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}\) into \(A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}\) with limited, maximum O(1) memory, and \(O(n)\) time you can follow the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traverse the array and for each element at index \(i\), swap it with the element at index \(i+n\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;literalblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;For i=1 to n:
  Swap A[i] with A[i+n]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the traversal is complete, the array will be rearranged as \(A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}\).
The above algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and uses only O(1) memory as only a constant number of variables are used for swapping elements in the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After following these steps, the original array \(A=\{a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n\}\) would be rearranged as \(A=\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n\}\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The described algorithm is \(O(n)\) time and \(O(1)\) memory, but the resulting array will be \(A=\{b_1,b_2, ... , b_n,a_1,a_2, ... , a_n\}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that hard if you do not have the \(O(1)\) memory constraint.
As a matter of fact it is so easy that it can be solved even by ChapGPT.
Or can it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Simpler problem, still not good answer from ChapGPT&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To rearrange the array \(A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}\) into \(A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}\), you can follow the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create two new arrays, one for the \(a\) values and another for the \(b\) values.
Initialize an empty array for the \(a\) values, say \(a_{new}\).
Initialize an empty array for the \(b\) values, say \(b_{new}\).
Traverse the original array and separate the \(a\) and \(b\) values into two separate arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For i=1 to n:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(a_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(a_{new}\)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(b_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(b_{new}\)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For i=n+1 to 2n:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(b_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(a_{new}\)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(a_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(b_{new}\)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concatenate the two new arrays in the desired order to get the final result.
Concatenate \(a_{new}\) and \(b_{new}\) in the order \(a_{new}, b_{new}\) to get the desired result.
After following these steps, the original array \(A={a_1,a_2, ... , a_n, b_1, b_2, ... , b_n}\) would be rearranged as \(A={a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2, ... , a_n,b_n}\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there is no need to explain why the solution is wrong, and overly complicated.
The allocation of the two arrays is unnecessary.
We need only one extra array of length \(2n\), say \(T\).
Then the code will look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For i=1 to n:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(a_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(T\)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt; \(b_i\) &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; \(T\)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà, you have the result in \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
Still not worried.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-without-the-on-time-constraint-on2&quot;&gt;4. Without the \( O(n)\) time constraint: \(O(n^2)\)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about giving some extra time instead of extra memory?
Let&amp;#8217;s keep the \(O(1)\) memory constraint, but allow \(O(n^2)\) time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is also simple to solve, but for some reason, ChatGPT gave such a foolish answer that I decided not to copy here.
I know, you are curious, but it has no value, totally gibberish.
The solution is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;olist arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;arabic&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to take \(b_i\)out from the array for every \(i=1,n\)one by one,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;push every element one position higher below \(b_i\) until we get to the place where \(b_i\) will get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;put \(b_i\) to its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Move all objects from&lt;/code&gt; \( 2i\) &lt;code&gt;till&lt;/code&gt; \(n+i\) &lt;code&gt;to the next position&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Put &lt;/code&gt; \(b_i\)&lt;code&gt;from the variable&lt;/code&gt; \(x\)&lt;code&gt;to the position 2i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first step, we have to move \(n-1\) objects.
During the second step, we have to move \(n-2\) objects, and so on.
Moving all the \(b_i; i=1,n\)elements will need \( \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) moves.
It means that this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\) time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that there is a faster, more complex solution that is \(O(n \log n)\) time.
Let&amp;#8217;s have a look at that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the array length is 2, in other words, the array is \(A=\{a_1,b_1\}\), then the solution is trivial.
In that case do not need to do anything, just return the array as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Funny (wrong) suggestion from CoPilot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the array is longer, then we can split it into two parts, rearrange them separately, and then merge the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above sentence is not part of the normal flow of this article.
I write this article with CoPilot switched on.
The above sentence was suggested by CoPilot for this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fun to write articles with CoPilot switched on (pronounce it as Copy-a-Lot).
I do not say it is easier, or less work.
Sometimes it feels like a little kid running around and making a mess while you try to clean your flat.
Rather the contrary, but undeniably &lt;em&gt;more fun.&lt;/em&gt;
Cursive words in the above paragraphs all were suggested by CoPilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, just let&amp;#8217;s go on with the normal text of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that the array length is \(n=2^m\).
Divide the array into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(Q_2=[a_{\frac n2+1},a_n\)],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(Q_3=[b_1-b_\frac n2\)],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(Q_4=[b_{\frac n2+1},b_n\)],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap the elements of \(Q_2\) and \(Q_3\)in a single loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For i=1 to &lt;/code&gt; \( \frac n2\)&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Swap&lt;/code&gt; \(a_{\frac n2+i}\) &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; \(b_i\)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we transform the array \(Q_1|Q_2|Q_3|Q_4\) into \(Q_1|Q_3|Q_2|Q_4\).
After this, the algorithm can be applied for the sub arrays \(Q_1|Q_3\) and \(Q_1|Q_4\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption that \(n=2^m\) helps to halve the array down to length 2.
When the length of the array is not some power of two, the halving is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm running time \(T(n) = 2T(\frac n2) + O(n)\).
The \(O(n)\)term is the time needed to swap the elements of \(Q_2\)and \(Q_3\).
The resulting time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-conclusion-and-takeaway&quot;&gt;6. Conclusion, and Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared this &quot;simple&quot; algorithmic problem with you.
It is haunting me for a few years.
The beauty of this problem is that it is simple, but not trivial.
If you happen to know the answer, tell me!
I am old enough accepting my limits, and it will more amaze me to see the solution than angry about wy I have not seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sidebarblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;CoPilot&amp;#8217;s suggestion&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The takeaway is that you should not be afraid of simple problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about AI?
What is the merit of all this?
Should we be afraid of AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is no.
There is no point of being afraid, generally.
We can be prepared, aware, but not afraid.
AI in its current form can help us solve problems, but it is immature.
I expect the change and maturing of AI will be extremely rapid to a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will transform how we work, but will not work instead of us or replace us.
Some people will lose jobs, but new jobs will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, people were afraid of computers.
As a matter of fact, the women doing the numerical calculations were called computers.
Their job does not exist today, but it did not disappear from day one to the next.
It took years to disappear.
We still do some calculations by hand.
We still use calculators on the job site.
There is even an anachronistic calculator app on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something similar will happen with AI.
The change will be gradual.
We will have time to adapt.
AI development is fast, and we feel that the development of new technologies speeds up.
However, this speed is limited by the adoption rate of humans.
Humans do not change that fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will look at some Java code that converts a number to Roman numerals.
We will look at different solutions and compare them.
You can read this article as a mental exercise, like a coding kata, but at the same time, we also discuss some coding styles.
If you like to use big words, we can say it is about code architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-problem&quot;&gt;1. The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number and want to convert it to Roman numerals.
Roman numerals are the numbers that we used in the Roman Empire.
They remained in use for a long time and are still used in some places.
A typical example is the face of some watches.
They denoted the numbers with letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of 1 was denoted with the letter &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, five was denoted with the letter &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, ten was denoted with the letter &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.
It is a kind of decimal notation with some additions.
The decimals are denoted by different symbols, namely &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, and not the position.
Additionally, there are symbols for 5, 50, and 500, namely &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;.
1, 2, and 3 are denoted by repeating the symbol &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, so they are &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;II&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;III&lt;/code&gt;.
Similarly, 10, 20, and 30 are denoted as &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;XXX&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.
A letter does not repeat more than three times in a row.
There are some exceptions in some watches, but that is an exception and not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need 4, you take the symbol for five and subtract the symbol for 1, so 4 is &lt;code&gt;IV&lt;/code&gt;.
The subtraction is denoted by placing the &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; before the &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;.
5, 6, 7, and 8 are denoted as &lt;code&gt;VI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VII&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;VIII&lt;/code&gt;.
Again 9 Would require four &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; characters, but that is not allowed.
Nine is denoted as &lt;code&gt;IX&lt;/code&gt;, where the &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; is before the &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;; again a subtraction.
The same logic applies to the other symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-solution-approach&quot;&gt;2. Solution approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1-interface&quot;&gt;2.1. Interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the solution, we will have an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1. public interface Romans {
 2.     String toRoman(int value);
 3.
 4.     static final int I = 1;
 5.     static final int II = 2;
 6.     static final int III = 3;
 7.     static final int V = 5;
 8.     static final int M = 1000;
 9.     static final int nulla = 0;
10.
11.     static void assertRange(int value) {
12.         if (value &amp;lt; 1 || value &amp;gt; 3999) {
13.             throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Counter &apos;%s&apos; grew too big to be formatted as a roman numeral&quot;.formatted(value));
14.         }
15.     }
16. }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical part is the &lt;code&gt;toRomans()&lt;/code&gt; method.
We will implement it in three different ways and compare the different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-2-test&quot;&gt;2.2. Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional implementation does not exist without tests.
The tests are straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1.     @Test
 2.     @DisplayName(&quot;Unitas testis pro minimo numeri converters&quot;)
 3.     void testTrivial() {
 4.         testRomanFormatAll(new RomansTrivial());
 5.     }
 6.
 7.     @Test
 8.     @DisplayName(&quot;Unitas testis pro simplici numeri converters&quot;)
 9.     void testSimple() {
10.         testRomanFormatAll(new RomansSimple());
11.     }
12.
13.     @Test
14.     @DisplayName(&quot;Unitas testis pro complexu numeri converters&quot;)
15.     void testComplex() {
16.         testRomanFormatAll(new RomansComplex());
17.     }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual method that does the testing calls the converter for all possible values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1.     private void testRomanFormatAll(Romans r) {
 2.         final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
 3.         for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt; 4000; i++) {
 4.             sb.append(i).append(&apos;=&apos;).append(r.toRoman(i)).append(&apos;\n&apos;);
 5.         }
 6.         Assertions.assertEquals(
 7.                 //&amp;lt;editor-fold desc=&quot;omnibus romanis numeris ab I = I ad MMMXCIX&quot;&amp;gt;
 8.                 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 9. 1=I
10. 2=II
11. 3=III
4008. &quot;&quot;&quot;
4009.                 //&amp;lt;/editor-fold&amp;gt;
4010.                 , sb.toString());
4011.     }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
As you can see from the line numbering, we have omitted some lines from the output.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-3-trivial-solution&quot;&gt;2.3. Trivial Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have all the roman numerals in a string, the lazy and most straightforward solution is to put them into an array and use indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1. public class RomansTrivial implements Romans {
 2.
 3.     private static final String[] ROMANS = {
 4.             //&amp;lt;editor-fold desc=&quot;omnibus romanis numeris a I = i ad MMMCMXCIX in linea ordinata&quot;&amp;gt;
 5.             &quot;I&quot;,
 6.             &quot;II&quot;,
 7.             &quot;III&quot;,
 8.             &quot;IV&quot;,
4001.             &quot;MMMCMXCVII&quot;,
4002.             &quot;MMMCMXCVIII&quot;,
4003.             &quot;MMMCMXCIX&quot;
4004.             //&amp;lt;/editor-fold&amp;gt;
4005.     };
4006.
4007.     public String toRoman(int value) {
4008.         Romans.assertRange(value);
4009.         return ROMANS[value - I];
4010.     }
4011. }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;admonitionblock note&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
Again, we have omitted some lines from the output.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following approach is to be a bit more complex.
Storing 3999 numbers in an array may be simple, but somehow, it is not elegant.
We are programmers, solving problems with algorithms and not simply listing all the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-4-simple-solution&quot;&gt;2.4. Simple Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex approach still uses a string array.
After all, the selection of the letters representing Roman numerals was arbitrary at the time.
The Roman scholars did not consult their 2000 years descendants to find out the best way to represent the numbers aligning with modern computer technology like ASCII codes and Unicode.
We have to list the numbers and the corresponding Roman numerals in the same order, either in a data structure or the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;listingblock&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot; data-lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt; 1. public class RomansSimple implements Romans {
 2.     int [] places = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
 3.     String [] numerals = {&quot;M&quot;, &quot;CM&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;CD&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;XC&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;XL&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;IX&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;IV&quot;, &quot;I&quot;};
 4.
 5.     public String toRoman(int value) {
 6.         Romans.assertRange(value);
 7.         final var s = new StringBuilder();
 8.         for( int j = 0; j &amp;lt; places.length; j++ ) {
 9.             while( value &amp;gt;= places[j] ) {
10.                 s.append(numerals[j]);
11.                 value -= places[j];
12.             }
13.         }
14.         return s.toString();
15.     }
16. }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at the number; if it is larger than 1000, it will start with &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;.
If it is larger than 3000, it will start with &lt;code&gt;MMM&lt;/code&gt;; if it is larger than 2000, it will start with &lt;code&gt;MM&lt;/code&gt;; and if it is larger than 1000, it will start with one &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;.
Roman numerals are the sum of the letters, except for the subtraction rule.
However, we can look at &lt;code&gt;CM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IX&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;IV&lt;/code&gt; as individual symbols.
They are two letters, but the algorithm never relies on the fact that the other values are represented with single letters.
That way, we can go on with all elements, from large to smaller ones.
When the value is larger than the actual number, we add the symbol to the output string and remove the number from the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this is the solution that fits most of the developers.
Simple and does not require the excessive list of the roman numerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-5-complex-solution&quot;&gt;2.5. Complex Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real developer, however, does not like a solution that implements logic in the data structure.
The rule that a symbol representing a smaller number than the subsequent one is subtracted from the subsequent one is something that can be programmed.
It does not need a data structure.
The data structure is redundant, and any redundancy in the code is against maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or not.
Mind my words; we will revisit it in the following main section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for the solution that does not use an excessive data structure is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

19.                 lineaAedificator.append(NUMERI[j]);
20.                 valorem -= numeralis;

22.             final var compensatio = II - inclinatio;
23.             final var decimales = numeralis / (V * compensatio);
24.             if (valorem &amp;gt;= numeralis - decimales) {
25.                 lineaAedificator.append(NUMERI[j + compensatio]).append(NUMERI[j]);
26.                 valorem -= numeralis - decimales;
27.             }
28.             numeralis /= II + III * inclinatio;
29.             inclinatio = I - inclinatio;
30.         }
31.         return lineaAedificator.toString();

33. }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a real geek implementation with a minimal data structure and all logic in the code.
The source of this was a stone tablet found in the ruins of the ancient Roman Empire.
As such, it can be treated as a reference implementation, and it does not need explanation.
The code is evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-selecting-a-solution&quot;&gt;3. Selecting a Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen three different solutions.
Two were extreme in pushing the scale from minimal code maximum data to maximum code minimum data.
The simple solution was a solution in the middle of the scale.
Which one should we use in a professional application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, think about it, and have an opinion.
When you have that, then think about the reason.
Why would you select that solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create a professional solution, we usually follow engineering practices.
One of these is to avoid code redundancy.
But at the same time, we also hate data redundancy.
The reason is that any redundancy in the code or data is a potential source of errors.
In the case of code, we call these errors bugs.
In the case of data, we call these errors data errors or data corruption.
We do not like either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to be rude, but who cares what we like or hate?
The client certainly does not.
What matters is client satisfaction.
What the client cares about in a business environment is money.
In this case, the money they spend on the solution and the money they gain using the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s have a look at it for this specific example.
It may seem intriguing, and it is.
The example is too simple to be a real-world problem.
However, this simplicity makes it pure and a prime and hopefully entertaining example for the demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any difference in what the client can earn depending on the solution we choose?
In this case, barely.
The speed may be a differentiating factor.
Functionality is not.
Functionality is the same in all three cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one solution is significantly faster than the other, then it should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is significant in this case?
Is 10% significant?
Or a 100 times speed up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-1-speed-difference&quot;&gt;3.1. Speed Difference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed difference is significant if the client can earn more money with the faster solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-1-1-execution-speed&quot;&gt;3.1.1. Execution Speed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client uses a server application starting once every month once.
The startup of the application takes 1 second.
We can invest some effort to speed up this startup time to be under 10ms.
It probably does not matter.
This 100 times speed up is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client uses an application that does a geology calculation.
The geo engineer uses the result, and based on that, he starts a new calculation.
In this iterative way, he finds the optimal solution for &amp;#8230;&amp;#8203; whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation takes 8 hours and 30 minutes.
They start it every time before going home, and they have the result the next morning.
This way, they can do one iteration per day.
They are very strict about not doing overtime or overwork.
They are not German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the application and speeding it up 10% so that it finishes in 7 hours and 39 minutes does not seem, at first sight, to be significant.
However, such a speed-up means the geo-engineer can do two iterations daily.
Starting one in the morning, looking at the result, and starting the next one in the afternoon before they leave for their &lt;em&gt;repas du soir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is the money, precisely the client&amp;#8217;s money.
In the example of converting numbers to roman numerals, it is hard to say without knowing the specific business application in which one creates more money for the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-1-2-development-speed&quot;&gt;3.1.2. Development Speed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other speed difference is the speed of development.
It is significant if one solution can be finished sooner and can start earning money for the client.
The money the client gains this way has to be put into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I was working on a project where the client was managing debts.
The company got a CSV file of 10,000 debtors.
The people were calling them, texting them, writing emails, and so on.
Every contact was recorded into the Excell file.
At the end of the month, they sent the csv, including the transactions, back to the lenders&apos; aggregator.
The following month they started with 10,000 different debtors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;#8217;s added value was the knowledge of how to convince the debtors to pay.
I had known the owners for a long time; I knew they did not do anything illegal or unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day the aggregator asked them if they could scale up to handle 100,000 debtors every month.
They could hire more people, but that amount of records was already beyond the technical capability of the Excel-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked for a quote to create an application to handle the 100,000 debtors.
There were two offers.
My company, which I had back in 2007, offered a solution based on Jira with plugins.
We guaranteed to deliver a working version for the import in two weeks, and at the end of the first month, the version capable of exporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other company offered a solution developed from scratch using Delphi.
Their development time was six months.
The significant advantage of their proposed solution was that it was to be fine-tuned for the specific business application.
Calling one client after the other, the administrator did not need to click three or more times from one issue to the other, like in the case of a Jira-based solution.
It was explained as a click, click, enter, done workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client ordered both solutions.
We delivered in two weeks and finished a rudimentary but usable working solution in six weeks.
They used this solution for the next 13 months until the other solution became ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is the money, specifically the client&amp;#8217;s money.
In converting numbers to roman numerals, the trivial solution was five minutes, including the unit tests.
The simple solution was 30 minutes.
The complex solution was 2 hours, except it was already available since the Roman ages; we just had to copy the characters from the stone tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-1-3-development-speed-again&quot;&gt;3.1.3. Development Speed Again&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development speed is critical not only for the client but also for the developer.
The more time you spend developing a feature, the more your cost is.
The client pays for the feature, but the developer pays for the time spent.
The market determines the price and is only vaguely coupled with the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is already the cost side of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-1-4-maintenance&quot;&gt;3.1.4. Maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following cost factor is the cost of maintenance.
Developing an application is not the end of the story.
The application has to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements of the client may change in the future.
The market and environment change and the client must respond to these business changes.
It will require a change in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be bugs in the application discovered only after the application is in production.
These also need a change in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of bugs, it is evident that the maintenance cost is the developer&amp;#8217;s burden.
In the case of new features, it is not so evident, but it is.
Just as in the case of the original development, the client pays for the feature.
They do not care and do not even know what the cost of the development is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development cost is discussed with the client often during the sales negotiation.
It, however, is a sales issue.
The client wants to pay the lowest price, and the salesperson wants to sell the highest.
Neither is interested; however, pushing the price to a range will make the other party stand up from the table and leave now or in the future.
That is why the costs are mentioned at all.
It is all sales negotiation.
The cost is on the production side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the three examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ulist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the trivial solution with a vast data set,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the simple solution with a small set, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the complex solution with a non-redundant data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to estimate the cost of the maintenance of the different parts.
What is the probability that a discovered bug or a new feature will need a code change or data change?
What is the cost of such a change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fun in this example is that there is barely any imaginable possibility for a change request.
Roman numerals have been with us for thousands of years, they are literally carved in stone.
They are not going to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected this example not only because it was a coding kata a few days ago at the company where I work but also because recently, I had a change request in one of my open-source projects.
Jamal, you can reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/verhas/jamal&quot; class=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;https://github.com/verhas/jamal&lt;/a&gt;, has a counter that can format the counter value as roman numerals.
Created, done, tested, and released a few years back.
What change could you imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I could not imagine any, either.
Until someone asked me if it would be possible to format the counter value as &lt;code&gt;IIII&lt;/code&gt; for four.
It is an alternate format for &lt;code&gt;IV&lt;/code&gt; in some cases.
I remember my grandmother had a clock with roman numerals, with &lt;code&gt;IIII&lt;/code&gt; for four.
It was hand-painted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-summary&quot;&gt;4. Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sectionbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a little fun with the Roman numerals.
Do not take all the sentences in this article as facts, especially not the ones written in Latin.
Or about the Latins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed code and data complexity a bit, though I mainly left it to your imagination.
What we discussed, however, is the base of any professional development decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We follow object-oriented programming principles.
We do functional programming.
We avoid copy-paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?
Because, in most cases, it is the right thing to do.
Because, in most cases, it is the practice that will result in the lowest cost for us.
Because in most of the cases&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis in this article is on the &lt;em&gt;&quot;in most of the cases&quot;&lt;/em&gt; part.
There can be exceptions, and as a true professional, you have to be able to recognize them.
There is only one single thing that you MUST NOT do: use this article as an excuse for wanting to be lazy.
It is not about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
