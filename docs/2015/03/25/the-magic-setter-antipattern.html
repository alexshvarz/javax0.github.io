<p>Setters and getter are evil. When the JavaBean definition was created it seemed to be a good idea. But they do a lot of harm to the Java community. Not as many as the null pointer generally, but enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The very first thing is that many juniors believe that implementing setters and getter (hey, it is just a few click in Eclispe!) does encapsulation properly. Should I detail why it does not?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other things is that using setters and getters are against YAGNI. YAGNI stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You aren&#8217;t gonna need it</a>. It means that you should not develop a code that the project does not need <em>now</em>. The emphasis is on the word <em>now</em>. Many programmers tend to develop code that extends the actual functionality and does something more general than actually needed. Even though in principle it could be valuable: in most of the practical cases it is not. The code becomes more complex and on the other hand project never develops to the stage where the generalization the programmer created is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setters and getter are a clean, simple and very broadly used example of YAGNI. If the setter does nothing else but sets the value of a field and if the getter does nothing else than returns the value of the field then why do we need them at all? Why do not alter the access modifier of the field to the value that the setter and the getter has (probably <code>public</code>)?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer usually is that you <em>may need to implement</em> some more complex functionality either in the getter or in the setter and then you need not change the "interface" the bean provides. The words "<em>you may need to implement</em>" suggests that this is YAGNI. What is more: it is dangerous. Implementing the setters and the getters you implicitly expose the implementation of the class. What does a setter do? Sets the value of a field. For example <code>setBirthDate()</code> by definition sets the field <code>birthDate</code>. And this is the way your users, who write the code calling the setter will think about it. You may document in your JavaDoc that <code>setBirthDate()</code> actually "specifies" a birth date but that is too late. You named the method to be a setter and that is it. Nobody reads JavaDoc. API rulez.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, when you change your code and <code>setBirthDate()</code> does not only sets birth date or does not even do that the users will not be notified. The change is silent and you just changed the interface you implicitely provided for your users. There will be bugs, debug session, new releases and this is good, because this creates workplace (feel the irony, please). If the users were provided direct access to the fields moving the fields from <code>public</code> to behind the barricades of <code>private</code> access modifier would cause compile time errors. Perhaps it is only a weird personal taste, but I prefer compile time errors more than bugs. They are easier (read: cheaper) to fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not worry: you still can modify your API. You can still remove your setters and getters from the set of methods and force fellow programmers to fix their code that implicitly assumed that setters really set and getters get. Please do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What the actual story was making me write this?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once upon a time there was an object that could do something. To perform its task you could set either field <code>aaa</code> or the field <code>bbb</code>, but never both. The application was developed this way and all was good for more than six years. Some day a young programmer princess came riding on white horse wanting to make the world to be a better place. He wanted to make the before mentioned class safer and modified the setter <code>setAaa()</code> to <code>null</code> the field <code>bbb</code> and the other way around. Unit tests shined. Coverage was 100%. (I should learn not to lie.) He submitted a new release of the library and a few weeks later he finished his internship and went back to school. That time the applications started to use the new version of the library. And they failed miserably because of this small change and rolled back to the old version. We all had hard time and summing up, well, the corporate spent approximately one person year of work caused by the simple change not to mention the amount of hair that programmers tore off from their head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did the programs failed? There was some code that cloned an object containing the fields <code>aaa</code> and <code>bbb</code> in a way like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    BadBean newBadBean = new BadBean();
    newBadBean.setAaa(oldBadBean.getAaa());
    newBadBean.setBbb(oldBadBean.getBbb());</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see the point. In the new bean the field <code>aaa</code> was always <code>null</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have read this article you will never try to create a clever setter. I know you won&#8217;t! You know the saying: <em>Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</em> Behold!</p>

<p>I do not think that we have to choose who was wrong at this late point. The fact that the cloning code was not appropriate does not lift the responsibility of somebody changing an already established interface. It is not the one or the other case. Both practices are wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case of changing the setter and getter there was good intent to correct a mistake. However&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in my belief&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it was done in a wrong way. If the patient walks with a drag because of a broken leg it may not be the best approach to break the other leg. The original problem breaking the first leg was the use of setters and getters exposing the internals of the bean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making the bean clonable, or providing an appropriate builder for the bean would have been good. But that was not what the person making the "correction" did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DRY: It is just another principle that was violated. It still not validates the wrong movement. A mistake at one place does not justify another mistake another place. It may also worth mentioning that violating DRY you can see many times in large organization. You can see examples of some functionality that has its logical place in one library belonging to one group. and is needed by another. The solution would be to manage the change of the library. It may need many organizational management effort. Programmers are not good in managing and organizing issues. They love to create code that works and have things controlled on the technical level. SO they develop the code where they need it. This clearly leads to code duplication, violation of DRY. But in this case this is already organization issue, that I would not like to touch, out of subject. I am not good at managing things, I like to code and control things on the technical level.</p>

<p>You missed his point. Using the setters and getters in your classes exposes the object state almost as much as leaving them public. And if you&#8217;re going to provide getters and setters that aren&#8217;t doing anything, you might as well be making the fields public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Granted, overall this was still a poor design, not originally preventing both from getting set, and making the copier do things a dumb way. But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that just placing getters and setters for all your fields is a bad idea. Unless it&#8217;s sole purpose is as a data object. Even then, the data should be set in the constructor and the object remain unchangeable, removing the need for setters.</p>

<p>Peter: Are you using non-private fields instead of accessor methods since then? What are your experiences with them?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my read, the main failure in this story was, that nobody reviewed the code of an intern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You and I know that 100% code coverage for unit tests doesn&#8217;t guarantee perfect code. For setters it would be sensible to make assertions that they don&#8217;t make other unwanted side effects for more possible incoming parameters. So not just an assert would be needed which checks that the actual field has been set, but asserts for other fields that they are not changed, or actually changed if it&#8217;s needed. Of course this is an overkill, but an experienced programmer will find this kind of mistake by the first look at the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing is about cloning: Cloning is a very risky operation as for real creatures as well as digital objects. I believe that cloning should be handled by the object itself but not externally. Or if it&#8217;s handled externally it should happen with extra care. If the object can clone itself it can use its private fields.</p>

<p>One of the main problem that getters and setter are expected by frameworks. E.g. all web framework I know is not able to use beans without setters and getters.

<p>Hm, I think this post might easily lead to wrong conclusions, although I do understand the deeper issue.
Imagine your story is slightly changed, with the engineer being a senior from the security/QA team, and the bean change is part of making it more robust: the bean was created so you could not set both values. The cloning code in question does that (sets both fields), thereby resulting in unsupported/undefined behavior. Either the bean already caught such wrong behavior (obviously not), otherwise any bets are off with code that happily explores the land of unspecified/unsafe behavior. Would you still blame the engineer for such change? I wouldn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s more the question which of the two fragile pieces of code eventually breaks first&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Yes, getters and setters used to be a technical necessity in ancient Java Beans days and now turn into pure evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both me and Java (e.g. parallelised lambdas) coming of age, I see a computing world populated by two species:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Real" objects implementing behaviour - heavy weights</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DTOs aggregating values, very much like arrays or collections or maps - light weights, no behaviour added beyond the one inherited from the aggregates</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the latter, IMHO, they should:
1. be immutable (all fields are final)
2. have no setters or getters at all
3. are created using either builder of factory patterns</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Promotes both reliability and performance. Performance by obviating the need for synchronisation per se (and most programers do fail miserably in this area). Reliability by preventing arbitrary hidden code sequences to change state, either willingly or by chance - effectively turning an object into a global variable of ancient Fortran days: Disgusting!
Promotes documentation: It&#8217;s far more easy to document a field, than to copy and paste it to getters / setters (and keep it synchronised as well). Thus the documentation is per se canonical (i.e. there&#8217;s only one place instead of multiple ones that inevitably tend to diverge over time). Noone likes to create setters and getters manually - thus they are likely to end up having no documentation at all (i.e. Eclipse: Sets the value of / gets the value of). Using a run of the mill IDE, all getters and setters are bound to have the very same effect: They set, or they get - only God knows what and what for.
IMHO the most important fact (implicitly resulting from 1. immutability): For each instance, there is just ONE place that is/was responsible for creating a particular DTO instance. A constructor / factory / builder is far more easy to prove correct than a sequence of mutations that tends to escape human control with as little as three or four independent variables - short of applying a rule engine to enforce constraints. And even constraints turn out hard to implement with objects, whose state is never final&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>I came here because a coworker of mine has argued that JavaBeans is an anti-pattern, and I honestly wanted to read the cases people make as to why they believe that is so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First off, yes, your example does show a glaringly bad design.  However, I would argue that it is NOT the fault of the JavaBeans (anti???)-pattern, but a flaw in the design of the API in question.  Let me explain&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You say you have a bean that should only be set to "aaa" or "bbb", with the other value being set to null.  The assumption was noble in that if I set "aaa" then I should null "bbb" or if I set "bbb" I should null "aaa", but that&#8217;s where you went wrong.  I think the proper action would have been to throw an exception the moment you tried to set both OR when you tried to use the bean that had both set (I would opt for when it was set so the exception is thrown immediately when the problem occurred).  That would have been the proper API way to handle a problem where the bean state is not in a bad way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second problem: Your unit tests may have all be spot-on, but your integration testing was not.  Had you had a decent set of regression tests it should have identified the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My arguments as to why JavaBeans are good:
  - It is a well documented, well supported pattern in the community.  Sticking to well supported, well documented patterns is a good thing.
  - It helps people coming behind you to follow your code.  It is WAY easier to find all the locations a value is set when I can search "setAAA()" and not have to worry about places where I get AAA showing up
  - Almost ALL the tools used to make our life easier in the Java world revolve around the JavaBean pattern (see well documented, well supported above)
  - It allows you the chance to deal with exception handling like invalid values being set or lazy-inited collections (largest cause of NPEs, IMHO, is null collections being returned)
  - It gives you a chance to make properties be "read-only" or "write-only", which is sometimes a good thing</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are there ways to handle all of the above without using JavaBeans?  Sure, absolutely.  Am I advocating that JavaBeans is the best, most sacred pattern to follow?  No, surely not.  But to say it&#8217;s "bad" or "outdated" or "worthless" is probably not correct either.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for the JavaDoc comment, I actually read that too.  It was another argument my coworker has brought up.  I am sorry, I have been programming Java for almost 20yrs and I still have a hard time reading my own code I wrote after having not looked at it for some time, let alone trying to figure out what some other person who thinks they are the smartest developer alive does in their fancy attempt to flex their programming muscles.</p>
