<p>I am preparing a regular expression tutorial update for the company I work for. The original tutorial was created in 2012 and Java has changed a wee bit since then. There are new Java language releases and though the regular expression handling is still not perfect in Java (nb. it still uses non-deterministic FSA) there are some new features. I wrote about some of those in a previous post focusing on the new Java 9 methods. This time however I have to look at all the features that are new since 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="1-splitasstream-since-1-8">1. splitAsStream since 1.8</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way I found <code>splitAsStream</code> in the <code>java.util.regex.Pattern</code> class. It is almost the same as the method <code>split</code> except that what we get back is not an array of <code>String</code> objects but a stream. The simplest implementation would be something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public Stream&lt;String&gt; splitAsStream(final CharSequence input) {
    return Arrays.stream(p.split(input));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I could see many such implementations when a library tried to keep pace with the new winds and support streams. Nothing is simpler then converting the array or the list available from some already existing functionality to a stream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution, however, is sub-par losing the essence of streams: doing only as much work as needed. And this, I mean "doing only as much work as needed" should happen while the stream is processed and not while the developer converts the array or collection returning method to a stream returning one. Streams deliver the results in a lean way, just in time. You see how many expressions we have for being lazy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JDK implementation leverages the performance advantages of streams. If you look at the source code you can see immediately that the implementation is slightly more complex than the before mentioned simple solution. Lacking time I could devote to the study of the implementation and perhaps lacking interest, I used another approach to demonstrate that the implementation respects the stream laziness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The argument to the method is a <code>CharSequence</code> and not a <code>String</code>. <code>CharSequence</code> is an interface implemented by <code>String</code> but we can also implement it. To have a feeling how lazy the stream implementation in this case is I created an implementation of <code>CharSequence</code> that debug prints out the method calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">class MyCharSequence implements CharSequence {

    private String me;

    MyCharSequence(String me) {
        this.me = me;
    }

    @Override
    public int length() {
        System.out.println("MCS.length()=" + me.length());
        return me.length();
    }

    @Override
    public char charAt(int index) {
        System.out.println("MCS.charAt(" + index + ")=" + me.charAt(index));
        return me.charAt(index);
    }

    @Override
    public CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) {
        System.out.println("MCS.subSequence(" + start + "," + end + ")="
                                              + me.subSequence(start, end));
        return me.subSequence(start, end);
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having this class at hand, I could execute the following simple main method:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pattern p = Pattern.compile("[,\\.\\-;]");
    final CharSequence splitIt =
              new MyCharSequence("one.two-three,four;five;");
    p.splitAsStream(splitIt).forEach(System.out::println);
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output shows that the implementation is really lazy:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>MCS.length()=24

<p>The implementation goes ahead and when it finds the first element for the stream, it returns it. We can process the string “one” and it processes further characters only when we get back for further elements. Why does it have to call the method length three times at the start? I have no idea. Perhaps it wants to be very sure that the length of the sequence is not magically changes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a good example how a library has to be extended to support streams. It is not a problem if the application just converts the collection or array to a stream in the first version but if analysis shows that the performance pays back the investment then the real stream laziness should be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-1-side-note">2.1. Side note</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of <code>CharSequence</code> is mutable, but the processing requires that it remains constant otherwise the result is undefined. I can  confirm that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next week I will show a possible use of the <code>splitAsStream</code> that makes use of the feature that it does not read further in the character sequence than it is needed.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t see it calling length three times at the start, even using the original JDK 8 release from 2014. It gets called twice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first call to length() is when the Matcher is created (it stores the length of the string). Then length() gets called each time it tries to get the next match - if the current position is the end of the string (current == input.length()), there are no more matches.</p>
