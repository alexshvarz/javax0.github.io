<p>I recently received my complimentary copy of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-9-regular-expressions">"Java 9 Regular Expressions"</a> from <a href="https://anubhava.wordpress.com/">Anubhava Srivastava</a> published by Packt. The book is a good tutorial and introduction to anyone who wants to learn what regular expressions are and start from scratch. Those who know how to use regex the book may still be interesting to reiterate the knowledge and to deepen into a more complex feature like zero-length assertions, backreferences, and alike.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article, I will focus on the regular expression features that are specific to Java 9 and were not available in earlier version of the JDK. There is not many, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="1-java-9-regular-expression-module">1. Java 9 Regular Expression Module</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JDK in Java 9 is split up into modules. One could rightfully expect that there is a new module for the regular expression handling packages and classes. Actually, there is none. The module <code>java.base</code> is the default module on which all other modules depend on by default and thus the classes of the exported packages are always available in Java applications. The regular expression package <code>java.util.regex</code> is exported by this module. This makes the development a bit simpler: there is no need to explicitly 'require' a module if we want to use regular expressions in our code. It seems that regular expressions are so essential to Java that it got included in the base module.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-regular-expression-classes">2. Regular Expression Classes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The package <code>java.util.regex</code> contains the classes</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>MatchResult</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Matcher</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Pattern</code> and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>PatternSyntaxException</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only class that has changed API is <code>Matcher</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-changes-in-class-matcher">3. Changes in class Matcher</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The class <code>Matcher</code> adds five new methods. Four of those are overloaded versions of already existing methods. These are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>appendReplacement</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>appendTail</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>replaceAll</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>replaceFirst</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>results</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first four exists in earlier versions and there is only change in the types of the arguments (after all that is what overloading means).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="4-appendreplacementtail">4. appendReplacement/Tail</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In case of <code>appendReplacement</code> and <code>appendTail</code> the only difference is that the argument can also be a <code>StringBuilder</code> and not only <code>StringBuffer</code>. Considering that <code>StringBuilder</code> introduced in Java 1.5 something like 13 years ago nobody should say that this is an inconsiderate act.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is interesting though how the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html">currently online version of the API JDK</a> documents the behaviour of <code>appendReplacement</code> for <code>StringBuilder</code> argument. The older, <code>StringBuffer</code> argumented method explicitly documents that the replacement string may contain named references that will be replaced by the corresponding group. The <code>StringBuilder</code> argumented version misses this. The documentation seems like copy/paste and then edited. The text replaces "buffer" to "builder" and alike and the text documenting the named reference feature is deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried the functionality using Java 9 build160 and the outcome is the same for these two method versions. This should not be a surprise since the source code of the two methods is the same, a simple copy/paste in the JDK with the exception of the argument type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seems that you can use</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Test
    public void testAppendReplacement() {

        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat(?&lt;plural&gt;z?s?)");
        //Pattern p = Pattern.compile("cat(z?s?)");
        Matcher m = p.matcher("one catz two cats in the yard");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (m.find()) {
            m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog${plural}");
            //m.appendReplacement(sb, "dog$001");
        }
        m.appendTail(sb);
        String result = sb.toString();
        assertEquals("one dogz two dogs in the yard", result);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>both the commented lines or the line above each. The documentation, however speaks only about the numbered references.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="5-replaceallfirst">5. replaceAll/First</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also an "old" method that replaces matched groups with some new strings. The only difference between the old version and the new is how the replacement string is provided. In the old version the string was given as a <code>String</code> calculated before the method was invoked. In the new version the string is provided as a <code>Function&lt;MatchResult,String&gt;</code>. This function is invoked for each match result and the replacement string can be calculated on the fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowing that the class <code>Function</code> was introduced only 3 years ago in Java 8 the new use of it in regular expressions may be a little slap-dash. Or, perhaps &#8230;&#8203; may be we should see this as a hint that ten years from now, when the class <code>Fuction</code> will be 13 years old, we will still have Java 9?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lets dig a bit deeper into these two methods. (Actually only to <code>replaceAll</code> because <code>replaceFirst</code> is the same except that it replaces only the first matched group.) I tried to create some not absolutely intricate examples when such a use could be valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first sample is from the JDK documentation:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Test
    public void demoReplaceAllFunction() {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("dog");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("zzzdogzzzdogzzz");
        String result = matcher.replaceAll(mr -&gt; mr.group().toUpperCase());
        assertEquals("zzzDOGzzzDOGzzz", result);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not too complex and shows the functionality. The use of a lambda expression is absolutely adequate. I can not imagine a simpler way to uppercase the constant string literal "dog". Perhaps only writing "DOG". Okay I am just kidding. But really this example is too simple. It is okay for the documentation where anything more complex would distract the reader from the functionality of the documented method. Really: do not expect less intricate examples in a JavaDoc. It describes how to use the API and not why the API was created an designed that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But here and now we will look at some more complex examples. We want to replace in a string the <code><mark></code> characters with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and so on. The string contains numbered items and in case we insert a new one into the string we do not want to renumber manually. Sometimes we group two items, in which case we write <code></mark>#</code> and then we just want to skip a serial number for the next <code>#</code>. Since we have a unit test the code describes the functionality better than I can put it into words:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Test
    public void countSampleReplaceAllFunction() {
        AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("#+");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("# first item\n" +
                "# second item\n" +
                "## third and fourth\n" +
                "## item 5 and 6\n" +
                "# item 7");
        String result = matcher.replaceAll(mr -&gt; "" + counter.addAndGet(mr.group().length()));
        assertEquals("1 first item\n" +
                "2 second item\n" +
                "4 third and fourth\n" +
                "6 item 5 and 6\n" +
                "7 item 7", result);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://javax0.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/replacealllambda.png" alt="replacealllambda">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lambda expression passed to <code>replaceAll</code> gets the counter and calculates the next value. If we used one <code>#</code> then it increases it by 1 if we used two, then it adds two to the counter and so on. Because a lambda expression can not change the value of a variable in the surrounding environment (the variable has to be effectively final) the counter can not be an <code>int</code> or <code>Integer</code> variable. We need an object that holds an int value and can be changed. <code>AtomicInteger</code> is exactly that even if we do not use the atomic feature of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next example goes even further and does some mathematical calculation. It replaces any floating point formatted number in the string to the sine value of it. That way it corrects our sentence since sin(pi) is not even close to pi, which can not be precisely expressed here. It is rather close to zero:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Test
    public void calculateSampleReplaceAllFunction() {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?(?:[Ee][+-]?\\d{1,2})?");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("The sin(pi) is 3.1415926");
        String result = matcher.replaceAll(mr -&gt; "" + (Math.sin(Double.parseDouble(mr.group()))));
        assertEquals("The sin(pi) is 5.3589793170057245E-8", result);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will also play around a bit with this calculation for the demonstration of the last method in our list, which is a brand new one in the <code>Matcher</code> class.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="6-stream-results">6. Stream results()</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new method <code>results()</code> returns a stream of the matching results. To be more precise it returns a <code>Stream</code> of <code>MatchResult</code> objects. In the example below we use it to collect any floating point formatted number from the string and print their sine value comma separated:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Test
    public void resultsTest() {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?(?:[Ee][+-]?\\d{1,2})?");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("Pi is around 3.1415926 and not 3.2 even in Indiana");
        String result = String.join(",",
                matcher
                        .results()
                        .map(mr -&gt; "" + (Math.sin(Double.parseDouble(mr.group()))))
                        .collect(Collectors.toList()));
        assertEquals("5.3589793170057245E-8,-0.058374143427580086", result);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="7-summary">7. Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new regular expression methods introduced in the Java 9 JDK are not essentially different from what was already available. They are neat and handy and in some situation , hey may ease programming. There is nothing that could have not been introduced in the earlier version. This is just the way of Java to make such changes to the JDK slow and well thought. After all that is why we love Java, don&#8217;t we?</p>
