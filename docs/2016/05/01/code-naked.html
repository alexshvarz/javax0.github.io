The present problem is that still there is no unit test. But we have no time to write unit test for the whole program. There are zillion of lines of code developed during the last few hundred years.

We do ad-hoc testing. Okay. Then let&#8217;s just get back to the basics. Why do we have unit tests? What is the primary reason? To have working and tested code. Im my opinion this is more like documentation. Unit test is a live documentation that is more likely to be maintained than any other documenation. You just created a few lines of code without documentation. I get your point, but we just do not have time for that. Let&#8217;s look at the following situation. It is summer and hot. You wake up late and want to rush to fetch the bus. You take the shower and drink your coffe and run to the bus. Right? Right. You do not even dress. Run out naked. No! No! I dress! But you have no time. You are in a rush. If you have time to dress yourself why do you let your code run to production without unit tests naked? I get the point. But you can survive without unit tests. If you run on the street naked you will not survive. Why is that? The summer is hot, you will not catch cold. Yeah, but police would catch you. So this is a kind of society issue, is it? Yes, it is. And the coding society is not that matured yet, it lets you run naked without unit tests. I assume&#8230;&#8203; yes." />

<p>ah, come on peter, you know unit testing is for wussies. anything you can test by unit testing is so simple it&#8217;s actually embarrassing you have to test it. anyway, any code that is so divided that all its pieces can be unit-tested separately is guaranteed to be a shameless resource hog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>now, integration tests&#8230;&#8203; that&#8217;s where the point is. alas, they are almost as complicated as (and in most cases, actually MORE complicated than) the software they&#8217;re testing. the systems i code would humongously benefit from integration tests as they tend to have a lot of simple parts interconnected in very, hm, exciting ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>but most of the clients are, "nah, we&#8217;ll fix any errors that pop up in the production run." actually, unless you&#8217;re stupid enough to code bugs that cause actual unfixable data corruption or hard cash losses, then, with a bit of a devotion to fixing errors, it&#8217;s a viable option.</p>
