<p>That is because the references that Java uses to access objects are very similar to pointers. If you have experience with C programming before Java it may be easier to think about the values that are stored in the variables as pointers that point to some memory locations holding the objects. And it is more or less ok. More less than more but that is what we will look at now.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="1-difference-between-reference-and-pointer">1. Difference between reference and pointer</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/12960/brian-agnew">Brian Agnew</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2629357/does-java-have-pointers">summarized</a> on stackoverflow there are two major differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no pointer arithmetic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>References do not "point" to a memory location</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="1-1-missing-pointer-arithmetic">1.1. Missing pointer arithmetic</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have an array of a <code>struct</code> in C the memory allocated for the array contains the content of the structures one after the other. If you have something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C">struct circle {
   double radius;
   double x,y;
}
struct circle circles[6];</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>it will occupy <code>6*3*sizeof(double)</code> bytes in memory (that is usually 144 bytes on 64 bit architecture) in a continuous area. If you have something similar in Java, you need a class (<a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html">until we get to Java 10 or later</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-Java" data-lang="Java">class Circle {
   double radius;
   double x,y;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and the array</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-Java" data-lang="Java">Circle circles[6];</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>will need 6 references (48 bytes or so) and also 6 objects (unless some of them are null) each 24bytes data (or so) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26357186/what-is-in-java-object-header">object header</a> (16bytes). That totals to 288bytes on a 64bit architecture and the memory area is not continuous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you access an element, say <code>circles[n]</code> of the C language array the code uses pointer arithmetic. It uses the address stored in the pointer <code>circles</code> adds <code>n</code> times <code>sizeof(struct circle)</code> (bytes) and that is where the data is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java approach is a bit different. It looks at the object <code>circles</code>, which is an array, calculates the <code>n</code>-th element (this is similar to C) and fetches the reference data stored there. After the reference data is at hand it uses that to access the object from some different memory location where the reference data leads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in this case the memory overhead of Java is 100% and also the number of memory reads is 2 instead of 1 to access the actual data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="1-2-references-do-not-point-to-memory">1.2. References do not point to memory</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java references are not pointer. They contain some kind of pointer data or something because that comes from the nature of today computer architecture but this is totally up to the JVM implementation what it stores in a reference value and how it accesses the object it refers to. It could be absolutely ok though not too effective implementation to have a huge array of pointers each pointing to an object of the JVM and the references be indices to this array.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality JVM implement the references as a kind of pointer mix, where some of the bits are flags and some of the bits are "pointing" to some memory location relative to some area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why do JVMs do that instead of pointers?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason is the garbage collection. To implement an effective garbage collection and to avoid the fragmentation of the memory the JVM regularly moves the objects around in the memory. When memory occupied by objects not referenced anymore are freed and we happen to have a small object still used and referenced in the middle of a huge memory block available we do not want that memory block to be split. Instead the JVM moves the object to a different memory area and updates all the references to that object to keep track of the new location. Some GC implementations stop the other Java threads for the time these updates happen, so that no Java code uses a reference not updated but objects moved. Other GC implementations integrate with the underlying OS virtual memory management to cause page fault when such an access occurs to avoid the stopping of the application threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However the thing is that references are NOT pointers and it is the responsibility of the implementation of the JVM how it manages all these situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next topic strongly related to this area is parameter passing.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-are-parameters-passed-by-value-or-passed-by-reference-in-java">2. Are parameters passed by value or passed by reference in Java?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first programming language I studied at the uni was PASCAL invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a>. In this language the procedure and function arguments can be passed by value or by reference. When a parameter was passed by reference then the declaration of the argument in the procedure or function head was preceded by the keyword <code>VAR</code>. At the place of the use of the function the programmer is not allowed to write an expression as the actual argument. You have to use a variable and any change to the argument in the function (procedure) will have effect on the variable passed as argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you program in language C you always pass a value. But this is actually a lie, because you may pass the value of a pointer that points to a variable that the function can modify. That is when you write things like <code>char *s</code> as an argument and then the function can alter the character pointed by <code>s</code> or a whole string if it uses pointer arithmetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In PASCAL the declaration of pass-by-value OR pass-by-reference is at the declaration of the function (or procedure). In C you explicitly have to write an expression like <code>&amp;s</code> to pass the pointer to the variable <code>s</code> so that the caller can modify it. Of course the function also has to be declared to work with a pointer to a whatever type <code>s</code> has.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you read PASCAL code you can not tell at the place of the actual function call if the argument is passed-by-value and thus may be modified by the function. In case of C you have to code it at both of the places and whenever you see that the argument value <code>&amp;s</code> is passed you can be sure that the function is capable modifying the value of <code>s</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is it then with Java? You may program Java for years and may not face the issue or have a thought about it. Java solves the issue automatically? Or just gives a solution that is so simple that the dual pass-by-value/reference approach does not exist?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sad truth is that Java is actually hides the problem, does not solve it. So long as long we work only with objects Java passes the objects by reference. Whatever expression you write to the actual function call when the result is an object a reference to the object is passed to the method. If the expression is a variable then the reference contained by the variable (which is the value of the variable, so this is a kind of pass-by-value) is passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you pass a primitive (<code>int</code>, <code>boolean</code> etc) then the argument is passed by value. If the expression evaluated results a primitive then it is passed by value. If the expression is a variable then the primitive value contained by the variable is passed. That way we can say looking at the three example languages that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>PASCAL declares how to pass arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C calculates the actual value where it is passed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java decides based on the type of the argument</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java, in my opinion, is a bit messy. But I did not realized it because this messiness is limited and is hidden well by the fact that the boxed versions of the primitives are immutable. Why would you care the underlying mechanism of argument passing if the value can not be modified anyway. If it is passed by value: it is OK. If it passed by reference, it is still okay because the object is immutable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would it cause problem if the boxed primitive values were mutable? We will see if and when we will have <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html">value types</a> in Java.</p>
