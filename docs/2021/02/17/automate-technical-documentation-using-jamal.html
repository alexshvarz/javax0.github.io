<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing good technical documentation is an art.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, &#8230;&#8203; to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But every art, like sculpting, has a craft part. You need chisels, hammers to form the sculpture out of the blob of marble. You need to learn the craft to master the art. Technical documentation writing is similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing sentences that are easy to read, entertaining for the reader is the art part. Fixing typos and grammatical errors is more like a craft. Making the documentation precise, to the point, and well structured is also the craft part. Crafts can be learned and aided with the right tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In technical documentation writing, the tools help address those tasks that are often performed manually though they could be automated. In this article, I will write about a tool that helps in that manner and which I used successfully to write documentation, many articles&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;also this one --and books.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="2-what-can-be-automated">2. What can be automated</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many things can be automated for technical document writing. I tried to gather a list from my experience, but it may not be complete. The list is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verhas/jamal/master/jamal-snippet/articleimages/tasks.svg" alt="tasks">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eliminate manual text repetition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transclude information from the documented system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checks internal consistency of the documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the consistency of the documentation with the documented system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following, I will talk shortly about these tasks, and then I will explain the tool that I use to address these.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-1-dry-in-documentation">2.1. DRY in Documentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself) is a fundamental and old principle in programming. If there are the same lines in the source, they should be singled out, moving the common code into a separate method, class, or other coding structure. Copy/Paste programming is evil and must not be done. It does not mean that there is no repeated code in the compiled binary code. Code generators are free to repeat code if they think that is better than in some way eliminating it. One famous example is when a short loop is extended, and the code is repeated instead of creating a binary looping construct. It may consume more memory, but at the same time, optimization may find it faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same should happen when you write the documentation. Except, you do not have methods or classes in the documents. You can reorganize your document into smaller sections, and then you can refer to the areas. It may have an impact on the readability. If the reader has to turn the pages instead of linear reading, comprehending the document becomes challenging. Using non-printed, non-linear documentation, a.k.a. hypertext eases a bit the page-turning, but the reader still can get mentally lost in the maze of the non-linear documentation. The ideal solution would be to have documentation, which is linear and contains all the interesting text for the particular user, reading it in the order as they want to read it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, it is impossible. With today&#8217;s technology, you cannot create a document that contains precisely what the reader wants to read at the very moment and changes for each reader and even for each reading. The best approach we have is repeating some of the text in the documentation. Some readers may find it boring, while others will just get what they need. Your document "source" should be DRY, and the repeating of the text, the copy-paste operation has to be automated. The advantage is: any change in the text is consistently propagated to every occurrence of the text.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-2-information-transclusion">2.2. Information Transclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A living document has to follow the change of the system it documents. In the case of software, this can partially be automated. A lot of data that may need to be included in the document is available in the source code. For example, the current version of the application, a numeric value, may be included in the documentation at different locations. Updating it to the latest version manually is almost always some error. Sooner or later, one or more references may skip the update and become stale. The solution is partial when we use the technique that eliminates DRY. We define the version in the document in one place, and it will be referred to in other places. It still needs that one place to be updated. Fetching the version number from the source code automatically is one level more automation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usage samples are also an excellent example for transclusion. When the usage samples are automatically fetched from the unit tests, they are guaranteed to run during the test execution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-3-internal-consistency">2.3. Internal Consistency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ensuring internal consistency of the document can also be automated to some level. It is such an essential factor that many documentation systems support it related to cross-references. The examples can be various.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may create a document with use cases. In the use cases, you use actors in the description. A document management system can ensure that all the actors used in the document are also defined. A similar check can be done for abbreviations and other things. Consistency, if it can be formally defined, can be checked by automated tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="2-4-external-consistency">2.4. External Consistency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just as well as the different parts of the document should be consistent and without contradiction, the documentation should also be consistent with the system it documents. It is similar to transcluding information from the source. The difference is that the information, in this case, is mainly existence only. For example, you reference a file, a directory, a method in a Java class. A tool can check that the directory, file, or method exists; it was not renamed nor deleted. Similarly, other consistency checks can be programmed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="3-document-writing-is-programming">3. Document Writing is Programming</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be some other cases where some automation may come into the picture. The general approach, however, should be to manage the document similar to the program source. Technical documents need maintenance. Documents have a source, and they should be structured. One change in the documented system should be followed by a single change in the document. Every other occurrence in the output should be created automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is very much similar to programming. The programmers write source code in a high-level programming language, and the compiler generates the machine code. Sometimes the compilation process is a long chain involving many tools. Programming in machine code is an art of the past. The advantages of using a high-level language fairly compensate for the extra effort using the compiler chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In technical documentation, the advantages, at least in the short run, are not so appealing. Creating a document using some WYSIWYG editor is easy as opposed to programming in assembly. It is easy to lure the technical writer to avoid some extra work at the start and avoid the document source code creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A work to be done tomorrow is always cheaper today than the avoidable work of now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same will not be true tomorrow. Creating the more complex but less redundant documentation source almost always payback, especially if we consider document quality coming from consistency and up-to-date-ness.</p>

<h2 id="4-the-tool-java-macro-language">4. The Tool: Java Macro Language</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the rest of this article, I will describe a tool that can automate document management tasks. The tool is the Java version of the text processor Jamal. Originally the name was standing for Just Another Macro Language, and it was created in the late 1990-ies in Perl. A few years ago, I rewrote the implementation in Java, with the original functionality enhanced. Since the application is based on Java, it is now named Java Macro Language, abbreviated as Jamal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic concept of Jamal is that the input text containing free text and macros mixed is processed. The output is a text with all the macros executed and evaluated. The syntax of the macros is free. The only requirement is that each of them starts and ends with a specific string. The start and end string can be defined when the macro processor is initialized. It can also be changed on the fly in the input text. When I document Java programs, then I usually use <code>{%</code> as start string and <code>%}</code> as end string. That way, a simple macro definition will be</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{%@define lastUpdated=2021-02-17 16:00%}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later you can refer to this macro as</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{%lastUpdated%}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and it will be replaced by the value <code>2021-02-17 16:00</code> for each use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal distinguishes user-defined and built-in macros. The example above, named <code>lastUpdated</code> is a user-defined macro, as it is defined in the input text. The macro defining it, named <code>define</code> is built-in. It is implemented as a Java class implementing the Jamal <code>Macro</code> interface. The built-in, Java implemented macros are provided in JAR files, in libraries. The core package contains the essential macros, like <code>define</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>options</code>, <code>comment</code>, and a few others. These macros are not task-specific. They are needed generally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other libraries, like the <code>jamal-snippet</code> library, contain macros that support some specific task. The mentioned <code>jamal-snippet</code> library supports document management.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-1-snippet-handling-transclude">4.1. Snippet Handling, Transclude</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original idea of the snippets is not new. The basic approach to use the source code as part of the documentation originates from D. Knuth with Web and Tangle as early as 1984. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB" class="bare">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB</a> Creating a program that contains the documentation and the execution code did not become popular as it needed a lot of extra work from the developers and an additional compilation step. The current trend includes the documentation into the source code as a comment. In the case of Java programs, this is JavaDoc. It is also a trend to use unit tests as a form of documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two are separate, and both lack the aspect that the other provides. JavaDoc does not show sample use unless someone copies some sample code into it manually. The unit test does not contain a proper explanation unless someone copies fragments or the whole from the JavaDoc to the unit test comments. JavaDoc is converted to navigable HTML pages. Unit tests are source code. Although the best documentation is the source code, it would be nice to have a better, more document-like format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we talk about snippets, then we copy code fragments automatically into the documentation. In practice, the documentation format is Asciidoc or MarkDown these days. Both formats allow code samples in the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>using Jamal, the snippets can be marked in the Java source code or any other source code with</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">    snippet snippetName
    end snippet</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>lines. The <code>snippetName</code> should be replaced by a unique name that identifies the snippet, and all the lines between the <code>snippet</code> and <code>end snippet</code> lines will be the snippet itself. The snippets are gathered using the <code>{%@snip:collect directory%}</code> macro. Here <code>directory</code> is either a directory or a single file. The collection process reads each file and collects the snippets. After this the snippets can be referenced using the <code>{%@snip snippetName%}</code> macro. When Jamal runs, the macro is replaced with the actual value of the snippet. It ensures that the code sample in the documentation is up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other macros can trim the content, replace some strings in the samples, number the lines, skip some lines, and so on. With these, you can include any code sample.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snippets are suitable for code samples, but not only for code samples. As JavaDoc is included in the source code, some parts of the documentation can also be included in the code as comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the implementation of the macro <code>directory</code> contains the following lines:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    // snippet dirMacroFormatPlaceholders
    "$name", name, // gives the name of the directory as was specified on the macro
    "$absolutePath", dir.getAbsolutePath(), // gives the name of the directory as was specified on the macro
    "$parent", dir.getParent() // the parent directory
).and(
    "$canonicalPath", dir::getCanonicalPath // the canonical path
    //end snippet</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These lines list the different placeholders and their values that the built-in template handler knows. The documentation includes this snippet with the following lines:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">{%@define replace=|^.*?"(.*?)"|* `$1`!|!.*?//||%}
{%@define pattern=\)\.and\(%}
{%#replaceLines{%#killLines{%@snip dirMacroFormatPlaceholders %}%}%}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Note: the actual version is a bit more complicated, as you will see later.) It inserts the content of the snippet evaluating the <code>snip</code> macro. The content of the sippet is then passed to the macro <code>killLines</code>. This macro will delete all the lines that match the regular expression defined in the macro <code>pattern</code>. The result is still further modified by the <code>replaceLines</code> macro. It executes the Java String <code>replaceAll()</code> method on each line with the arguments defined in the macro <code>replace</code>. The final result, inserted into the output is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">* `$name` gives the name of the file as was specified on the macro
* `$absolutePath` the absolute path to the file
* `$parent` the parent directory where the file is
* `$canonicalPath` the canonical path</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, the document is much easier to maintain. The documentation of the parameters is along with the code, and that way, it is harder to forget to update the documentation. Also, the name of the placeholder is taken directly from the source code. Even if the developer makes a typo naming the placeholder in the example above, the documentation will contain the name as it is in the code and the characters it has to be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Snippets can come from other sources, not only from file snippet fragments. The built-in macro <code>snip:xml</code> reads a while XML file and assigns it to a macro name. This macro is similar to the built-in core macro <code>define</code>. It also defines a user-defined macro. In this case, however, the macro is not a constant string with argument placeholders as those defined, calling the macro <code>define</code>. In this case, the content is a whole parsed XML file, and the one argument the macro can and should have when invoked must be an XPath. As you can guess, the result of the macro call is the value in the XML found by the XPath.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, the module documentation <code>README.adoc.jam</code> for <code>jamal-plantuml</code> contains the following lines close to the start of the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">{%@snip:xml pom=pom.xml%}\
{%#define PLANTUML_VERSION={%pom /project/dependencies/dependency/artifactId[text()="plantuml"]/following-sibling::version/text()%}%}\
{%#define VERSION={%pom /project/version/text()%}%}\</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It reads the <code>pom.xml</code> file of the macro and defines the <code>PLANTUML_VERSION</code> and <code>VERSION</code> macros to hold the current version of the used PlantUml library and the version of the project, respectively. Later in the documentation, both <code>{%PLANTUML_VERSION%}</code> and <code>{%VERSION%}</code> can be used and will be replaced in the output with the up-to-date version.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have seen that snippet texts can be fetched from arbitrary source files and XML files. In addition to that, snippets can also be defined in <code>.properties</code> files (even XML format properties file) and can also be defined as a macro. The snippet definition as a macro using the <code>snip:define</code> built-in has a particular use that we will discuss later with the <code>snip:update</code> macro.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-2-file-directory-class-method-consistency">4.2. File, Directory, Class, Method &#8658; Consistency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The macros <code>file</code>, <code>directory</code>, <code>java:class</code>, and <code>java:method</code> are macros that can keep the code consistent with the system. These macros add barely any formatting to the output; therefore, their use needs discipline. They check that the argument file, directory, class, or method exists. If the entity does not exist, then the macro throws an exception. If the entity was renamed, moved, or deleted, the documentation has to be updated, or else it does not compile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the macros <code>file</code> and <code>directory</code> is straightforward. They check the existence of the file and directory specified as the argument. The name can either be absolute or relative to the input document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Checking the existence of a class or method is not that straightforward. It needs a Java environment that has the class on the classpath. It is recommended to invoke Jamal from a unit test to convert the document from the input to output. This article is also written using Jamal as a preprocessor, and it is converted from a unit test of the module <code>jamal-snippet</code> using the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">private static void generateDoc(final String directory, final String fileName, final String ext) throws Exception {
    final var in = FileTools.getInput(directory + "/" + fileName + "." + ext + ".jam");
    final var processor = new Processor("{%", "%}");
    final var result = processor.process(in);
    FileTools.writeFileContent(directory + "/" + fileName + "." + ext, result);
}

@Test
void convertSnippetArticle() throws Exception {
    generateDoc(".", "ARTICLE", "wp");
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the unit test&#8217;s execution, the classes of the documented system are on the classpath or on the module path, and that way, these macros, <code>java:class</code> and <code>java:method</code> work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="4-3-updating-the-input">4.3. Updating the Input</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jamal-snippet</code> library has a particular macro, <code>snip:update</code>, which does something exceptional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Built-in macro implementations get the part of the input, which is between the opening and closing string. It is the part of the input that they are supposed to work on. What they get is the input object containing not only the character but also a position coordinate. This coordinate contains the file name and the line/column position of the input in the file. Some macros use this coordinate to report the position of some error. Other macros, like <code>include</code> or <code>import</code>, use the file name to calculate the imported or included file path relative to the one that contains the macro.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The macro <code>snip:update</code> uses the file name to access the file and modify it physically. The macro scans the file and looks for lines that look like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">{%@snip id
   ...
%}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the lines with that pattern are found, then the lines between the first and last line, practically the lines denoted with <code>&#8230;&#8203;</code> above, are replaced with the snippet&#8217;s actual content. It will help the maintenance of the input document. When you write the document, it is easier to see the actual snippet and not only the reference to the snippet. It is also easier to debug the line killing, character replacement, and other snippet formatting transformations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The macro <code>snip</code> is not disturbed by these lines. The syntax of the <code>snip</code> macro is like <code>snip id &#8230;&#8203; anything treated as a comment&#8230;&#8203;</code> to allow this particular use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The invocation of the macro updating of the input should occur at the end of the document when all snippets are already defined. It is also essential to save the input to the version control before converting. The use of this possibility makes it possible to include into the document the formatted snippets. It is done, for example, in the documentation of the macro <code>directory</code>. The sample presented before was a simplified one. Here you can see the real one making use of updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<p>This structure includes the snippet  <code>dirMacroFormatPlaceholders</code> and converts enclosing it into macros <code>killLines</code> and <code>replaceLines</code>.

The name of the new snippet is <code>dirMacroFormatPlaceholdersFormatted</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this, when this new, already formatted snippet is defined, it is referenced using the <code>snip</code> macro to be included in the output. When the macro <code>snip:update</code> is used at the end of the file, this second use of the <code>snip</code> macro is updated, and the formatted lines are inserted there, as you can see.</p>

<p>The first use of the macro <code>snip</code> is not updated because there are extra characters before using the macro. Also, there are extra characters after the snippet identifier.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using diagrams are very important in the documentation. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, especially if your readers are non-native and do not even know a thousand words. An excellent tool to create diagrams is PlantUml. The source for the diagrams in this tool is a text that describes the UML diagram structurally. A simple sequence diagram can look like the following:</p>

<p>PlantUml is a widely used tool, and it has integration with many document processors. That way, it is integrated with Markdown and Asciidoc as well. Using Jamal as a preprocessor instead of the PlantUml direct integration has a few advantages, however.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You do not need to have the integration for PlantUml installed on the environment where the document rendering executes. You do not have it, for example, on GitHub or GitLab. Using Jamal, the PlantUml processing is done in your local environment, and after that, you just have a standard Markdown, Asciidoc, or whatever format you use. For example, this document uses WordPress markup, which does not have PlantUml integration, but it does not matter. The source named <code>ARTICLE.wp.jam</code> is processed by Jamal generating <code>ARTICLE.wp</code>, and it has everything it needs. Pictures are generated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jamal preprocessing has other advantages. In this article, as an example, the text of the UML diagram appears three times. Once when I display for the example of how a UML digram is defined in PlantUml. The second time when I show how it is integrated using a Jamal macro. The third time it appears as an image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source input contains it only once before the first use. The user-defined macro, named <code>alilove</code>, contains the actual UML, and the latter only references this macro to get the same text. If there is a need to update the structure, it must be done only in one place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another advantage is that the macros can access the running Java environment. It is already used when we check the existence and the naming of specific classes and methods. I also plan to extend the PlantUml integration with macros that can leverage the Java environment when we document our code. Running the conversion of the Jamal input during the unit tests reflection can get access to the classes. Using those, I plan to develop macros that need only the listing of the classes you want to be shown on a class diagram. The macro will discover all the relations between the classes and create a UML source to be converted to a diagram using PlantUml. Should your class structure change, the diagrams will also change automatically.</p>

<p>You should approach technical documentation like programming. Document writers should maintain document source code and compile the document from the source code.</p>

<p>You should automate document content management as much as possible. Use automated tools to transclude information from the documented system. Use automated tools to check the consistency of the documentation. Document everything close to the system documented. Use automated tools to integrate your document source.</p>

<p>Jamal is both A and B.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my experience the advantage is not that it speeds up the editing process of the source, rather than it simplifies the maintenance afterwards and provides a better cohesion between the different document parts and between the documentation and the documented system. For example having a parameter in the Java code assigned to <code>static final</code> field it is possible to get the value into the documentation using a macro. When the value changes you do not need to manually update the documentation. The macro will automatically fetch the value either using a pattern matching and sucking the value out of the source or using Java reflection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal is a text to text converter and it is not interested in formatting. You can have ASCIIDOC format document and work with Jamal. There are some processors that extend ASCIIDOC so you can use, for example plantUML. That is great and it is practically the same as Jamal plantUML support as far as the result is concerned: you will have plantUML pictures in your output and the plantUML source is inside your documentation and not in a separate file. But Jamal is not limited to ASCIIDOC. With a few macros you can tune it to include plantUML the same way into Markdown, or Wordpress formatted documents or whatnot. So long as long the output is text you can handle it with Jamal even of the output format does not natively support plantUML as an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PlantUML is one example, but there can be other examples what you want to integrate your documentation with. What do you do if you want to fetch something from a databe and insert into your documentation? What if you have to get it from the network and you also need a transformation? The convention way is to write a separate program that collects the information, transforms it and then you can some way include into your document. The flow is the same with Jamal, but the processor supports you with external modules. You can read an XML file. You can read properties files. You can read Yaml files using macros and insert the data from those into your document. If that is not enough you can write small JShell, Ruby, ScriptBasic or Groovy scripts that can fetch, convert and present data for the document. If all fails you can even write macros in Java and you do not need to manage all the file nagdling, temporary data storage and so on. It is all managed by Jamal and you can select the approach that fits you the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jamal also support JavaDoc implementing a Doclet and a Taglet. That way you can include into your JavaDoc document samples from your unit tests. After all unit tests are documentation. If that is not your desire you can also transform the unit test sample code using regular expression search and replace commands rendering a series of "Assertions.assertEquals&#8230;&#8203;" to HTML tables to display sample values. Or you can even write some simple scripts if regular expressions are not enough to transform the sample code to sample data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever you change the unit test extending the text data or modifying it the JavaDoc will automatically change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are only the features that already exist and tested and documented. The roadmap includes many morepossibilities.</p>

<p>Sounds great to have new tool supporting documentation activities. It has a very much needs. In order to understand properly, I have been thinking a lot what kind of tool JAMAL really is. Two main categories came up to my mind:
A) content creator - to speed up editing the raw text content
B) content source assembler - to collect of different sources and build up the final publication result</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, for both categories there are several existent candidates, so the next thought was about new features JAMAL provides compared to them. For exmaple, some years ago, I came across 'Asciidoc FX' (<a href="https://asciidocfx.com/" class="bare">https://asciidocfx.com/</a>) which is a very powerful asciidoc-based content editor with realtime WYSWYG capabilities. I liked it. It is very cool stuff. (Also has a function to include plantUML source.) As another example let me suggest to check the site builder 'Antora' (<a href="https://docs.antora.org/" class="bare">https://docs.antora.org/</a>) which also relies on asciidoc source files. BTW, has JAMAL got an own defined language? Asciidoc (<a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/" class="bare">https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/</a>) could be such a way. To sum up, I would say a toolset combining Asciidoc FX with Antora can support all the use cases you have described. And even if not, there is a chance to contribute with a new feature. :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I totally agree with you that documentation should handle like a source code. There are a lot of commmon in procedures such version management, building/compiling (=publishing), visualizing track changes, "running" (=rendering interactive content). Unfortunately toolchains and practice are not so matured yet. Hope, some time or other DevOps CI/CD pipelines will always handle publishing of complete SW documentations as well.</p>
